<p><span class="smcap">"Luck and Pluck"</span> appeared as a serial story
in the juvenile department of Ballou's Magazine
for the year 1869, and is therefore already
familiar to a very large constituency of young
readers. It is now presented in book form, as
the first of a series of six volumes, designed to
illustrate the truth that a manly spirit is better
than the gifts of fortune. Early trial and struggle,
as the history of the majority of our successful
men abundantly attests, tend to strengthen
and invigorate the character.</p>

<p>The author trusts that John Oakley, his young
hero, will find many friends, and that his career
will not only be followed with interest, but
teach a lesson of patient fortitude and resolute
endeavor, and a determination to conquer fortune,
and compel its smiles. He has no fear
that any boy-reader will be induced to imitate
Ben Brayton, whose selfishness and meanness
are likely to meet a fitting recompense.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCING TWO BOYS AND A HORSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"What</span> are you going to do with that horse,
Ben Brayton?"</p>

<p>"None of your business!"</p>

<p>"As the horse happens to belong to me, I should
think it was considerable of my business."</p>

<p>"Suppose you prove that it belongs to you," said
Ben, coolly.</p>

<p>"There is no need of proving it. You know it as
well as I do."</p>

<p>"At any rate, it doesn't belong to you now," said
Ben Brayton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to know why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"My mother."</p>

<p>"It wasn't hers to give."</p>

<p>"You'll find that the whole property belongs to
her. Your father left her everything, and she has
given the horse to me. Just stand aside there; I'm
going to ride."</p>

<p>John Oakley's face flushed with anger, and his eyes
flashed. He was a boy of fifteen, not tall, but stout
and well-proportioned, and stronger than most boys
of his age and size, his strength having been developed
by rowing on the river, and playing ball, in both of
which he was proficient. Ben Brayton was a year and a
half older, and half a head taller; but he was of a
slender figure, and, having no taste for vigorous out-of-door
amusements, he was not a match in strength
for the younger boy. They were not related by blood,
but both belonged to the same family, Ben Brayton's
mother having three years since married Squire Oakley,
with whom she had lived for a year previous as
house-keeper. A week since the squire had died, and
when, after the funeral, the will had been read, it was a
matter of general astonishment that John, the testator's
only son, was left entirely unprovided for, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the entire property was left to Mrs. Oakley. John,
who was of course present at the reading of the will,
was considerably disturbed at his disinheritance; not
because he cared for the money so much as because it
seemed as if his father had slighted him. Not a word,
however, had passed between him and his father's
widow on the subject, and things had gone on pretty
much as usual, until the day on which our story commences.
John had just returned from the village
academy, where he was at the head of a class preparing
for college, when he saw Ben Brayton, the son of
Mrs. Oakley by a former marriage preparing to ride
out on a horse which for a year past had been understood
to be his exclusive property. Indignant at this,
he commenced the conversation recorded at the beginning
of this chapter.</p>

<p>"Stand aside there, John Oakley, or I'll ride
over you!"</p>

<p>"Will you, though?" said John, seizing the horse
by the bridle. "That's easier said than done."</p>

<p>Ben Brayton struck the horse sharply, hoping
that John would be frightened and let go; but our
hero clung to the bridle, and the horse began to back.</p>

<p>"Let go, I tell you!" exclaimed Ben.</p>

<p>"I won't!" said John, sturdily.</p>

<p>The horse continued to back, until Ben, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a coward at heart, becoming alarmed, slid off from
his back.</p>

<p>"That's right," said John, coolly. "Another
time you'd better not meddle with my horse."</p>

<p>"I'll meddle with you, and teach you better
manners!" exclaimed Ben, a red spot glowing in
each of his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he struck John smartly over the
shoulders with the small riding-whip he carried.</p>

<p>John was not quarrelsome. I am glad to bear
this testimony to his character, for I have a very
poor opinion of quarrelsome boys; but he had a spirit
of his own, and was not disposed to submit tamely to
a blow. He turned upon Ben instantly, and, snatching
the whip from his hand, struck him two blows in return
for the one he had received.</p>

<p>"I generally pay my debts with interest, Ben
Brayton," he said, coolly. "You ought to have
thought of that before you struck me."</p>

<p>A look of fierce vindictiveness swept over the
olive face of his adversary as he advanced for another
contest.</p>

<p>"Stand back there!" exclaimed John, flourishing
the whip in a threatening manner. "I've paid you
up, and I don't want to strike you again."</p>

<p>"I'll make you smart for your impudence!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fumed Ben, trying to get near enough to seize the
whip from his hands.</p>

<p>"I didn't strike first," said John, "and I shan't
strike again, unless I am obliged to in self-defence."</p>

<p>"Give me that whip!" screamed Ben, livid with
passion.</p>

<p>"You can't have it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell my mother."</p>

<p>"Go and do it if you like," said John, a little contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Let go that horse."</p>

<p>"It's my own, and I mean to keep it."</p>

<p>"It is not yours. My mother gave it to me."</p>

<p>"It wasn't hers to give."</p>

<p>John still retained his hold of the saddle, and kept
Ben at bay with one hand. He watched his opportunity
until Ben had retreated sufficiently far to make
it practicable, then, placing his foot in the stirrup,
lightly vaulted upon the horse, and, touching him
with the whip, he dashed out of the yard. Ben sprang
forward to stop him; but he was too late.</p>

<p>"Get off that horse!" he screamed.</p>

<p>"I will when I've had my ride," said John, turning
back in his saddle. "Now, Prince, do your best."</p>

<p>This last remark was of course addressed to the
horse, who galloped up the street, John sitting on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
back, with easy grace, as firmly as if rooted to the
saddle; for John was an admirable horseman, having
been in the habit of riding ever since he was ten
years old.</p>

<p>Ben Brayton looked after him with a face distorted
with rage and envy. He would have given a great
deal to ride as well as John; but he was but an indifferent
horseman, being deficient in courage, and
sitting awkwardly in the saddle. He shook his fist
after John's retreating form, muttering between his
teeth, "You shall pay for this impudence, John Oakley,
and that before you are twenty-four hours older!
I'll see whether my mother will allow me to be insulted
in this way!"</p>

<p>Sure of obtaining sympathy from his mother, he
turned his steps towards the house, which he entered.</p>

<p>"Where's my mother?" he inquired of the servant.</p>

<p>"She's upstairs in her own room, Mr. Benjamin,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>Ben hurried upstairs, and opened the door at the
head of the staircase. It was a spacious chamber,
covered with a rich carpet, and handsomely furnished.
At the time of his mother's marriage to Squire Oakley,
she had induced him to discard the old furniture,
and refurnish it to suit her taste. There were some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
who thought that what had been good enough for the
first Mrs. Oakley, who was an elegant and refined
lady, ought to have been good enough for one, who,
until her second marriage, had been a house-keeper.
But, by some means,&mdash;certainly not her beauty, for she
was by no means handsome,&mdash;she had acquired an
ascendency over the squire, and he went to considerable
expense to gratify her whim.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley sat at the window, engaged in needlework.
She was tall and thin, with a sallow complexion,
and pale, colorless lips. Her eyes were gray and
cold. There was a strong personal resemblance between
Ben and herself, and there was reason to think
that he was like her in his character and disposition
as well as in outward appearance. She was dressed
in black, for the husband who had just died.</p>

<p>"Why have you not gone out to ride, Ben?" she
asked, as her son entered the room.</p>

<p>"Because that young brute prevented me."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"I mean John Oakley, of course."</p>

<p>"How could he prevent you?"</p>

<p>"He came up just as I was going to start, and told
me to get off the horse,&mdash;that it was his."</p>

<p>"And you were coward enough to do it?" said his
mother, scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I told him it was not his any longer; that
you had given it to me."</p>

<p>"What did he say then?"</p>

<p>"That you had no business to give it away, as it
was his."</p>

<p>"Did he say that?" demanded Mrs. Oakley, her
gray eyes flashing angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ride off without minding him?"</p>

<p>"Because he took the horse by the bridle, and
made him contrary; I didn't want to be thrown, so I
jumped off."</p>

<p>"Did you have the whip in your hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you lay it over his back? That
might have taught him better manners."</p>

<p>"So I did."</p>

<p>"You did right," said his mother, with satisfaction;
for she had never liked her husband's son. His frank,
brave, generous nature differed too much from her
own to lead to any affection between them. She felt
that he outshone her own son, and far exceeded him
in personal gifts and popularity with the young
people of the neighborhood, and it made her angry
with him. Besides, she had a suspicion that Ben was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
deficient in courage, and it pleased her to think that
he had on this occasion acted manfully.</p>

<p>"Then I don't see why you didn't jump on the
horse again and ride away," she continued.</p>

<p>"Because," said Ben, reluctantly, "John got the
whip away from me."</p>

<p>"Did he strike you with it?" asked Mrs. Oakley,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ben, vindictively. "He struck me
twice, the ruffian! But I'll be even with him yet!"</p>

<p>"You shall be even with him," said Mrs. Oakley,
pressing her thin lips firmly together. "But I'm
ashamed of you for standing still and bearing the insult
like a whipped dog."</p>

<p>"I tried to get at him," said Ben; "but he kept
flourishing the whip, so that I couldn't get a chance."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He's gone to ride."</p>

<p>"Gone to ride! You let him do it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it; he was too quick for me. He
jumped on the horse before I knew what he was going
to do, and dashed out of the yard at full speed."</p>

<p>"He is an impertinent young rebel!" said Mrs.
Oakley, angrily. "I am ashamed of you for letting
him get the advantage of you; but I am very angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with him. So he said that I had no business to give
you the horse, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has no more respect for you than for a
servant," said Ben, artfully, knowing well that nothing
would be so likely to make his mother angry as this.
Having once been in a subordinate position, she was
naturally suspicious, and apprehensive that she would
not be treated with a proper amount of respect by
those around her. It was Ben's object to incense his
mother against John, feeling that in this way he
would best promote his own selfish ends.</p>

<p>"So he has no respect for me?" exclaimed Mrs.
Oakley, angrily.</p>

<p>"None at all," said Ben, decisively. "He says
you have no right here, nor I either."</p>

<p>This last statement was an utter fabrication, as
Ben well knew; for John, though he had never liked
his father's second wife, had always treated her with
the outward respect which propriety required. He
was not an impudent nor a disrespectful boy; but he
had a proper spirit, and did not choose to be bullied
by Ben, whom he would have liked if he had possessed
any attractive qualities. It had never entered
his mind to grudge him the equal advantages which
Squire Oakley, for his mother's sake, had bestowed
upon her son. He knew that his father was a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
property, and that there was enough for both. When,
however, Ben manifested a disposition to encroach
upon his rights, John felt that the time for forbearance
had ceased, and he gave him distinctly to understand
that there was a limit beyond which he must
not pass. Very soon after Ben first entered the
family John gave him a thrashing,&mdash;in self-defence,
however,&mdash;of which he complained to his mother.
Though very angry, she feared to diminish her influence
with his father by moving much in the matter,
and therefore contented herself by cautioning Ben to
avoid him as much as possible.</p>

<p>"Some time or other he shall be punished," she
said; "but at present it is most prudent for us to
keep quiet and bide our time."</p>

<p>Now, however, Mrs. Oakley felt that the power
was in her own hands. She had no further necessity
for veiling her real nature, or refraining from gratifying
her resentment. The object for which she had
schemed&mdash;her husband's property&mdash;was hers, and
John Oakley was dependent upon her for everything.
If she treated him ungenerously, it would create unfavorable
comments in the neighborhood; but for
this she did not care. The property was hers by her
husband's will, and no amount of censure would
deprive her of it. She would now be able to enrich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Ben at John's expense, and she meant to do it.
Henceforth Ben would be elevated to the position of
heir, and John must take a subordinate position as a
younger son, or, perhaps, to speak still more accurately,
as a poor relation with a scanty claim upon
her bounty.</p>

<p>"I'll break that boy's proud spirit," she said to
herself. "He has been able to triumph over Ben;
but he will find that I am rather more difficult to deal
with."</p>

<p>There was an expression of resolution upon her
face, and a vicious snapping of the eyes, which boded
ill to our hero. Mrs. Oakley undoubtedly had the
power to make him uncomfortable, and she meant to
do it, unless he would submit meekly to her sway.
That this was not very likely may be judged from
what we have already seen of him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley's first act was to bestow on Ben the
horse, Prince, which had been given to John a year
before by his father. John had been accustomed to
take a daily ride on Prince, whom he had come to
love. The spirited horse returned his young master's
attachment, and it was hard to tell which enjoyed
most the daily gallop, the horse or his rider. To deprive
John of Prince was to do him a grievous
wrong, since it was, of all his possessions, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which he most enjoyed. It was the more unjustifiable,
since, at the time Prince had been bought for
John, Squire Oakley, in a spirit of impartial justice,
had offered to buy a horse for Ben also; but Ben,
who had long desired to own a gold watch and chain,
intimated this desire to his mother, and offered to relinquish
the promised horse if the watch and chain
might be given him. Squire Oakley had no objection
to the substitution, and accordingly the same day
that Prince was placed in the stable, subject to John's
control, a valuable gold watch and chain, costing precisely
the same amount, was placed in Ben's hands.
Ben was delighted with his new present, and put on
many airs in consequence. Now, however, he
coveted the horse as well as the watch, and his mother
had told him he might have it. But it seemed evident
that John would not give up the horse without a
struggle. Ben, however, had enlisted his mother as
his ally, and felt pretty confident of ultimate victory.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN RECEIVES SOME PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John Oakley</span> had triumphed in his encounter with
Ben Brayton, and rode off like a victor. Nevertheless
he could not help feeling a little doubtful and
anxious about the future. There was no doubt that
Ben would complain to his mother, and as it was by
her express permission that he had taken the horse,
John felt apprehensive that there would be trouble
between himself and his stepmother. I have already
said, that, though a manly boy, he was not quarrelsome.
He preferred to live on good terms with all,
not excepting Ben and his mother, although he had
no reason to like either of them. But he did not
mean to be imposed upon, or to have his just rights
encroached upon, if he could help it.</p>

<p>What should he do if Ben persevered in his claim
and his mother supported him in it? He could not
decide. He felt that he must be guided by circumstances.
He could not help remembering how four
years before Mrs. Brayton (for that was her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
then) answered his father's advertisement for a house-keeper;
how, when he hesitated in his choice, she
plead her poverty, and her urgent need of immediate
employment; and how, influenced principally by this
consideration, he took her in place of another to whom
he had been more favorably inclined. How she
should have obtained sufficient influence over his
father's mind to induce him to make her his wife after
the lapse of a year, John could not understand. He
felt instinctively that she was artful and designing,
but his own frank, open nature could hardly be expected
to fathom hers. He remembered again, how,
immediately after the marriage, Ben was sent for,
and was at once advanced to a position in the household
equal to his own. Ben was at first disposed to be
polite, and even subservient to himself, but gradually,
emboldened by his mother's encouragement, became
more independent, and even at times defiant. It was
not, however, until now that he had actually begun to
encroach upon John's rights, and assume airs of superiority.
He had been feeling his way, and waited
until it would be safe to show out his real nature.</p>

<p>John had never liked Ben,&mdash;nor had anybody else
except his mother felt any attachment for him,&mdash;but
he had not failed to treat him with perfect politeness
and courtesy. Though he had plenty of intimations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from the servants and others that it was unjust to
him that so much expense should be lavished upon
Ben, he was of too generous a nature to feel disturbed
by it, or to grudge him his share of his father's
bounty.</p>

<p>"There's enough for both of us," he always said,
to those who tried to stir up his jealousy.</p>

<p>"But suppose your father should divide his property
between you? How would you like to see Ben
Brayton sharing the estate?"</p>

<p>"If my father chooses to leave his property in that
way, I shan't complain," said John. "Fortunately
there is enough for us both, and half will be enough
to provide for me."</p>

<p>But John had never anticipated such a contingency
as Ben and his mother claiming the whole
property, and, frank and unsuspicious as he was, he
felt that his father would never have left him so entirely
dependent upon his stepmother unless improper
means had been used to influence his decision. There
was a particular reason which he had for thinking
thus. It was this: Three days before his father
died, he was told by the servant, on entering the
house, that the sick man wished to see him. Of
course he went up instantly to the chamber where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pale and wasted, Squire Oakley lay stretched out on
the bed.</p>

<p>He was stricken by a disease which affected his
speech, and prevented him from articulating anything
except in a whisper. He beckoned John to the bedside,
and signed for him to place his ear close to his
mouth. John did so. His father made a great effort
to speak, but all that John could make out was, "My
will."</p>

<p>"Your will, father?" he repeated.</p>

<p>The sick man nodded, and tried to speak further.
John thought he could distinguish the word "drawer,"
but was not certain. He was about to inquire further,
when his stepmother entered the room, and
looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Why have you come here to disturb your sick
father?" she asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"I did not come here to disturb him," said John.
"I came because he wished to speak to me."</p>

<p>"Has he spoken to you?" she asked, hastily.</p>

<p>"He tried to, but did not succeed."</p>

<p>"You should not allow him to make the effort. It
can only do him harm. The doctor says he must be
kept very quiet. You had better leave the room.
He is safest in my care."</p>

<p>John did leave the room, and though he saw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
father afterwards, it was always in his stepmother's
presence, and he had no farther opportunity of communicating
with him.</p>

<p>He could not help thinking of this as he rode along,
and wondering what it was that his father wished to
say. He knew that it must be something of importance,
from the evident anxiety which the dying man
manifested to speak to him. But whatever it was
must remain unknown. His father's lips were hushed
in death, and with such a stepmother John felt himself
worse than alone in the world. But he had a religious
nature, and had been well trained in the Sunday
school, and the thought came to him that whatever
trials might be in store for him he had at least
one Friend, higher than any earthly friend, to whom
he might look for help and protection. Plunged in
thought, he had suffered Prince to subside into a walk,
when, all at once, he heard his name called.</p>

<p>"Hallo, John!"</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw Sam Selwyn, son of Lawyer
Selwyn, and a classmate of his at the academy.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Sam?" he said, halting his horse.</p>

<p>"That is my impression," said Sam, "but I began
to think it wasn't just now, when my best friend
seemed to have forgotten me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was thinking," said John, "and didn't notice."</p>

<p>"Where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere in particular. I only came out for a
ride."</p>

<p>"You're a lucky fellow, John."</p>

<p>"You forget, Sam, the loss I have just met with;"
and John pointed to his black clothes.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, John, you know I sympathize with
you in that. But I'm very fond of riding, and never
get any chance. You have a horse of your own."</p>

<p>"Just at present."</p>

<p>"Just at present! You're not going to lose him,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Sam, I am expecting a little difficulty, and I shall
feel better if I advise with some friend about it. You
are my best friend in school, and I don't know but in
the world, and I've a great mind to tell you."</p>

<p>"I'll give you the best advice in my power, John,
and won't charge anything for it either, which is more
than my father would. You know he's a lawyer, and
has to be mercenary. Not that I ought to blame him,
for that's the way he finds us all in bread and butter."</p>

<p>"I'll turn Prince up that lane and tie him, and
then we'll lie down under a tree, and have a good
talk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>John did as proposed. Prince began to browse,
apparently well contented with the arrangement, and
the two boys stretched themselves out lazily beneath
a wide-spreading chestnut-tree, which screened them
from the sun.</p>

<p>"Now fire away," said Sam, "and I'll concentrate
all my intellect upon your case gratis."</p>

<p>"I told you that Prince was mine for the present,"
commenced John. "I don't know as I can say even
that. This afternoon when I got home I found Ben
Brayton just about to mount him."</p>

<p>"I hope you gave him a piece of your mind."</p>

<p>"I ordered him off," said John, quietly, "when he
informed me that the horse was his now,&mdash;that his
mother had given it to him."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"That it was not hers to give. I seized the horse
by the bridle, till he became alarmed and slid off.
He then came at me with his riding-whip, and struck
me."</p>

<p>"I didn't think he had pluck enough for that. I
hope you gave him as good as he sent."</p>

<p>"I pulled the whip away from him, and gave him
two blows in return. Then watching my opportunity
I sprang upon the horse, and here I am."</p>

<p>"And that is the whole story?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you want my advice?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll give it. Sink or swim, live or die, survive
or perish, stick to that horse, and defy Ben
Brayton to do his worst."</p>

<p>"It seems to me I've heard part of that speech
before," said John, smiling. "As to the advice, I'll
follow it if I can. I'm not afraid of anything Ben
Brayton can do; but suppose his mother takes his
part?"</p>

<p>"Do you think she will?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid she will."</p>

<p>"Then defy her too," said Sam, hastily.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said John. "I am
only a boy of fifteen, and she is my father's widow.
If she chooses to take the horse away, I don't know
that I can do anything."</p>

<p>"Ben Brayton is a mean rascal. Didn't he get a
gold watch at the same time that you got the horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he might have had a horse too, but he preferred
the watch and chain. They cost as much as
Prince."</p>

<p>"And now he wants the horse too?"</p>

<p>"So it seems."</p>

<p>"That's what I call hoggish. I only wish Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Brayton would come to school, and sit next to
me."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked John, a little surprised at this
remark.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I stick pins into him, that's all. I'd
make him yell like&mdash;a locomotive," said Sam, the
simile being suggested by the sound of the in-coming
train.</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>"That's an old trick of yours," he said, "I remember
you served me so once. And yet you profess
to be my friend."</p>

<p>"I didn't stick it in very far," said Sam, apologetically;
"it didn't hurt much, did it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't it though?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't mean to have it. Maybe I miscalculated
the distance."</p>

<p>"It's all right, if you don't try it again. And
now about the advice."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be imposed upon," said Sam. "Between
you and me I don't think much of your stepmother."</p>

<p>"Nor she of you," said John, slyly. "I heard
her say the other day that you were a disgrace to the
neighborhood with your mischievous tricks."</p>

<p>"That is the 'most unkindest' cut of all," said Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"I'd shed a few tears if I hadn't left my handkerchief
at home. I have a great mind to tell you
something," he added, more gravely.</p>

<p>"Well?" said John, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It's something that concerns you, only I happened
to overhear it, which isn't quite fair and
aboveboard, I know. Still I think I had better tell
you. You know my father was your father's lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, he as well as everybody else was surprised
at the will that left everything to your stepmother,
only he had the best reason to be surprised. I was
sitting out on our piazza when I heard him tell my
mother that only three months ago your father came
to his office, and had a will drawn up, leaving all the
property to you, except the thirds which your stepmother
was entitled to."</p>

<p>"Only three months ago?" said John, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And did he take away the will with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he thought at first of leaving it in my
father's charge, but finally decided to keep it himself."</p>

<p>"What can have become of it? He must have
destroyed it since."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father doesn't think so," said Sam.</p>

<p>"What does he think?"</p>

<p>"Mind you don't say a word of what I tell you,"
said Sam, lowering his voice. "He thinks that Mrs.
Oakley has put it out of the way, in order to get
hold of the whole property herself."</p>

<p>"I can hardly think she would be so wicked," said
John, shocked at the supposition.</p>

<p>"Isn't it easier to believe that of her, than to believe
that your father would deal so unjustly by
you?"</p>

<p>"I won't call it unjustly, even if he has really left
her the whole property," said John. "Still, I was
surprised at being left out of the will. Besides," he
added, with a sudden reflection, "there's something
that makes me think that the will you speak of is
still in existence."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>In reply John gave the particulars of his father's
attempt to communicate with him, and the few words
he was able to make out.</p>

<p>"I understand it all now," said Sam, quickly.</p>

<p>"Then you're ahead of me."</p>

<p>"It's plain as a pike-staff. Your father hid the
will, fearing that your stepmother would get hold of
it and destroy it. He wanted to tell you where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was. Do you know of any secret drawer in your
house?"</p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>"There must be one somewhere. Now, if you
want my advice, I'll give it. Just hunt secretly for
the drawer, wherever you think it may possibly be,
and if you find it, and the will in it, just bring it
round to my father, and he'll see that justice is done
you. Come, I'm not a lawyer's son for nothing.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you were right, Sam."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it I am. I'm your lawyer,
remember, and you are my client. I give advice
on the 'no cure no pay' system. If it don't amount
to anything I won't charge you a cent."</p>

<p>"And if it does?"</p>

<p>"If you get your property by my professional exertions,
I trust to your generosity to reward me."</p>

<p>"All right, Sam."</p>

<p>"Of course you won't let your stepmother suspect
what you're after. Otherwise she might get the start
of you, and find it herself, and then much good it
would do you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to think it is still in existence, and that
she hasn't destroyed it."</p>

<p>"She would if she could, you may depend on that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Sam, I'm much obliged to you for your advice.
I think I must be going now."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, old fellow. Keep a stiff upper
lip, and don't give up the ship&mdash;horsemanship, I mean.
I must go round to the office, and see if father
doesn't need a little professional assistance."</p>

<p>John leaped on Prince's back, and turned him in
the direction of home. The revelation which Sam
had made gave a new direction to his thoughts. If
his father had really intended to give him a share of
the estate, he felt that he ought to have it, and determined
to institute a search as cautiously as possible.</p>

<p>Driving into the yard he saw Ben sitting sullenly
on the door-step. He eyed John with no very friendly
glance.</p>

<p>"Where've you been?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Up the road," said John, briefly.</p>

<p>"It's the last time you'll ride <i>my</i> horse."</p>

<p>"It's not your horse."</p>

<p>"You'll find out whose horse it is," muttered Ben.</p>

<p>"I don't care about disputing with you," said
John, quietly, turning towards the stable.</p>

<p>"My mother wishes to see you at once; do you
hear?" said Ben, unpleasantly. "She's going to
make you apologize to me for your impudence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go in and see her as soon as I have put the
horse in the stable," John answered, quietly.</p>

<p>"I hate that fellow," muttered Ben, following our
hero with lowering eyes; "he puts on too many airs
altogether. But my mother'll fix him."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN'S TROUBLES BEGIN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> putting Prince in the stable, John went into
the house slowly, for he was in no hurry to anticipate
what he feared would be an unpleasant interview.</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Oakley, Jane?" he asked of a
servant whom he met in the hall.</p>

<p>"She's in the sitting-room, Master John," said
Jane. "She wants to see you immediately."</p>

<p>"Very well; I'll go in."</p>

<p>He heard steps behind him, and, turning, found that
Ben was following him.</p>

<p>"He wants to hear me scolded," thought John.
"However, I won't take any notice."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley was sitting in a rocking-chair. She
looked up with a frown as John entered. She had
never liked him, but since Ben had declared, falsely,
as we know, that John had no more respect for her
than a servant, this dislike was greatly increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>

She was inwardly determined to make his life as uncomfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," she said, "so you have come at last."</p>

<p>"I came as soon as Ben told me you wished to see
me," said John. "I only waited till I had put my
horse into the stable."</p>

<p>"<i>His</i> horse!" repeated Ben, by way of calling his
mother's attention to the claim to ownership expressed
in those words.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to consider it lucky that you
paid any attention to my words," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not failed in proper respect," said
John.</p>

<p>"It was very respectful in you to ride off with the
horse, when I had told Ben he might use it."</p>

<p>"It was my horse," said John, firmly. "If Ben
wanted it, he might ask me."</p>

<p>"Ask you, indeed!" repeated Ben, scornfully;
"you won't catch me doing that."</p>

<p>"It was enough that I told him that he might ride.
Didn't he tell you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then what right had you to refuse?"</p>

<p>"The horse is mine," said John. "It was given
me by my father."</p>

<p>"He allowed you to use it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"He gave it to me. At the same time he gave
Ben a watch, which he is wearing now. He has no
more right to demand my horse than I have to claim
his watch."</p>

<p>"You seem to forget," said Mrs. Oakley, coldly,
"that your father saw fit to leave me his property.
The horse forms a part of that property, and belongs
to me, and it is for me to say who shall ride on it.
Ben, you may ride on the horse to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" demanded Ben, triumphantly,
looking towards John.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said John, quietly, "you will order
Ben to let me have his watch to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall do no such thing," said Mrs. Oakley,
sharply, "and it is impudent in you to ask such a
thing."</p>

<p>"I don't see why it isn't fair," said John. "It
appears to me rather mean in Ben to want both, and
leave me neither."</p>

<p>"That is for me to decide," said Mrs. Oakley.
"There is one thing more I have to speak to you
about. My son tells me you were brutal enough to
strike him with the whip. Do you deny that?"</p>

<p>"I never deny what's true."</p>

<p>"Then you did strike him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I struck him twice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you have the impudence to stand there, and
say it to my face!"</p>

<p>"You asked me, and I have answered you. I
don't see why that should be called impudent."</p>

<p>"You glory in your disgraceful action," said Mrs.
Oakley, sharply.</p>

<p>"Did Ben tell you that he struck me first?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it. It was what you deserved,"
said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Then," said John, firmly, "I gave him what he
deserved. You can't expect me to stand still and be
struck without returning it."</p>

<p>"The only fault I find with Ben is, that he did not
strike you more than once," said Mrs. Oakley, in an
excited tone.</p>

<p>John glanced from the mother to her son, who was
evidently pleased with the reproaches John was receiving,
and said, quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think Ben had better not attempt it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" demanded Mrs.
Oakley, quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to strike Ben, or injure him in any
way," said John; "but I mean to defend myself if I
am attacked."</p>

<p>And Ben, though he chose to sneer, knew very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that, quietly as John spoke, he was thoroughly in
earnest, and would do precisely as he said. He knew
very well, too, that, though he was older and taller
than John, he would very likely be worsted in an encounter.
He preferred, therefore, that his mother
should fight his battles for him.</p>

<p>"You hear, mother," he said. "He defies you.
I knew he would. You remember what I told you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley did remember very well, and the recollection
made her angry.</p>

<p>"John Oakley," she said, "you will find that it
won't do to insult me."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to insult you, Mrs. Oakley," said
John. "I have not forgotten who you are, and I
shall try to treat you accordingly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" said Mrs. Oakley,
turning pale with rage.</p>

<p>She was misled by the statement Ben had made,
and she thought John referred to the fact that she
had been his father's house-keeper,&mdash;a point on
which she felt sensitive.</p>

<p>"I mean," said John, a little surprised at this outburst,
"that I have not forgotten that you are my father's
widow, and as such are entitled to my respect."</p>

<p>"Was that what you meant?" asked Mrs. Oakley,
suspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," said John. "What else could I
mean?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley turned to Ben, who shrugged his
shoulders, intimating that he did not believe it.</p>

<p>"All very fine," said his mother, "but words are
cheap. If you think I am entitled to your respect,
you will do as I require. Will you promise this?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not promise," said John. "If it
is anything I ought to do, I will do it."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> something you ought to do," said Mrs.
Oakley.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I require you immediately to apologize to my
son Benjamin, for the blows you struck him with the
whip this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I cannot do this," said John, firmly.</p>

<p>"Why can't you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because I had a good reason for striking him.
He ought to apologize to me for striking me first."</p>

<p>"Catch me doing it!" said Ben, scornfully.</p>

<p>"I have no fault to find with him for striking you,"
said Mrs. Oakley. "On the contrary, I think him
perfectly justified in doing so. You forced him off
the horse after I had given him permission to ride,
and I should have been ashamed of him if he had
not resisted. I am glad he gave you such a lesson."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more John looked at Ben, and was not surprised
to see the smile of triumph that rose to his
face as he listened to these words of his mother.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Oakley, impatiently, "what
have you to say?"</p>

<p>"What can I say? You are determined to find
me in the wrong."</p>

<p>"It is because you <i>are</i> wrong. I demand once
more, John Oakley, will you apologize to my
son?"</p>

<p>"I will not," said John, firmly.</p>

<p>"Please to remember that you are left dependent
upon me, and that your future comfort will be a
good deal affected by the way in which you decide."</p>

<p>"Whatever happens," said John, who partly
understood the threat, "I refuse to apologize,
unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"If Ben will say that he is sorry that he struck
me, I will say the same to him."</p>

<p>"Ben will do nothing of the kind," said Mrs.
Oakley, promptly. "I should be ashamed of him
if he did."</p>

<p>"Catch me apologizing to such a whipper-snapper
as you!" muttered Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I have no more to say," said John.</p>

<p>"But I have," said Mrs. Oakley, angrily. "You
have chosen to defy me to my face, but you will
bitterly repent of it. I'll break your proud spirit
for you!"</p>

<p>John certainly did not feel very comfortable as he
left the room. He was not afraid of what his stepmother
could do, although he knew she could annoy
him in many ways, but it was disagreeable to him to
feel at variance with any one.</p>

<p>"If my poor father had only lived," he thought,
"how different all would have been!"</p>

<p>But it was useless to wish for this. His father
was no longer on earth to protect and shield him
from the malice of Ben and his mother. Trials
awaited him, but he determined to be true to himself,
and to the good principles which he had been
taught.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Oakley, having once resolved to
annoy John, she lost no time in beginning her persecutions.
She had a small, mean nature, and nothing
was too petty for her to stoop to.</p>

<p>John and Ben had been accustomed to occupy
bedrooms on the second floor, very prettily furnished,
and alike in every respect. It had been the
policy of Squire Oakley to treat the two boys precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
alike, although Ben had no claim upon him, except
as the son of the woman whom he had married. Now
that he was dead, Mrs. Oakley determined that Ben
should occupy a superior position, and should be
recognized throughout the house as the eldest son
and heir. After her unsatisfactory interview with
John, just described, in which he had refused to
apologize, she summoned Jane, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jane, you may remove John's clothes from the
bedchamber where he has slept to the attic room
next to your own."</p>

<p>"Is Master John going to sleep there?" asked
Jane, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And shall I move Master Ben's things upstairs,
also?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Mrs. Oakley, sharply.
"What made you think of such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, ma'am; but who is going to have
Master John's room?"</p>

<p>"You ask too many questions, Jane. It is no
concern of yours that I am aware of."</p>

<p>Jane did not venture to reply, but went out muttering:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a shame, so it is, to put Master John upstairs
in that poor room, while Ben stays downstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
He's a young reprobate, so he is, just for all the
world, like his mother."</p>

<p>The fact was, that John was a favorite in the
house, and Ben was not. The latter was in the habit
of domineering over the servants, and making all the
trouble in his power, while John was naturally considerate,
and always had a pleasant word for them.
However, Mrs. Oakley's commands must be obeyed,
and Jane, much against her will, found herself
obliged to remove John's things to the attic. She
found John already in his chamber.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Master John," she said, "but I have
orders to move your things up to the attic."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed John, in amazement.</p>

<p>Jane repeated her words.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Oakley tell you to do that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master John, and a shame it is."</p>

<p>"Is Ben to go up into the attic too?"</p>

<p>"The mistress said no."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Jane; I'll go and speak to Mrs.
Oakley."</p>

<p>John went downstairs, and found his stepmother
in the room where he had left her.</p>

<p>"May I speak to you a moment, Mrs. Oakley?"
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you come to apologize for your impertinence
to me, and your rudeness to my son?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not," said John.</p>

<p>"Then I don't care to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Oakley, but Jane tells me that
you have ordered her to remove my things to the
attic."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Is Ben to go into the attic too?"</p>

<p>"No, he is not."</p>

<p>"Then why are you driving me from my room?"</p>

<p>"You seem to forget that you are only a boy.
This house is mine, and I shall make what arrangements
I please."</p>

<p>"The room in the attic is not nearly as good as
my present room."</p>

<p>"It is good enough for you."</p>

<p>"I am willing to go up there if Ben goes up, but I
claim to be treated as well as he."</p>

<p>"Ben is older than you. Besides, he is respectful
and dutiful, while you are impertinent and disobedient.
I shall treat you as well as you deserve."</p>

<p>"Why did you not make this change while my
father was alive, Mrs. Oakley?" said John, significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley colored, for she understood very well
the meaning of this question.</p>

<p>"I do not intend to be catechised by you," she
said, sharply. "I intend to do what I please in my
own house, and I shall not submit to have my arrangements
questioned."</p>

<p>"May I ask how my room is going to be used?"
said John, who wanted to be sure whether his stepmother
had any motive for the change except
hostility to himself.</p>

<p>"No, you may not ask," she said, angrily; "or if
you do, you need not expect any answer. And now
I will thank you to leave the room, as I have something
else to do besides answering impertinent questions."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to say, and John left the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, Master John," said Jane, who had waited
till his return, "what will I do?"</p>

<p>"You may move the things upstairs, Jane," said
John.</p>

<p>"It's a shame," said Jane, warmly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Jane," said John. "I don't like it
much myself, but I dare say it'll all come out right
after a while. I'll help you with that trunk. It's
rather heavy to carry alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Master John. Ben wouldn't offer to
help if he saw me breakin' my back under it. It's
easy to see which is the gentleman."</p>

<p>The room to which John's things were removed
was uncarpeted, the floor being painted yellow. It
had been used during Squire Oakley's life by a boy
who was employed to run errands, but who had been
dismissed by Mrs. Oakley, who was disposed to be
economical and save his wages. The bed was a
common cot bedstead, comfortable indeed, but of
course quite inferior to the neat French bed in which
John had been accustomed to sleep. There was a
plain pine table and bureau, in which John stored his
things. There was a small cracked mirror, and a
wash-stand with the paint rubbed off in spots. Altogether
it was hardly suitable for a gentleman's son to
sleep in. John, however, was not proud, and would not
have minded if there had not been malice on the part of
his stepmother. He had scarcely got moved when a
step was heard on the attic stairs, and Ben came up
to enjoy the sight of John's humiliation.</p>

<p>"So you've got a new room, John?" he said, smiling
maliciously.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said John, quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to lose so agreeable a neighbor," he
continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you?" said John, looking at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"But you'll be more at home up here," said Ben.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean it's more suitable for you."</p>

<p>"Ben Brayton," said John, his eyes flashing, "if
you have come up here to insult me, the sooner you
go down the better. Your mother has moved me up
here, for what reason I don't know. The only
satisfaction I have in the change is, that it removes
me further from you."</p>

<p>"You're uncommon polite since you've moved
into this elegant apartment," said Ben, tauntingly.</p>

<p>"Elegant or not, it is mine, and I want it to myself,"
said John. "Leave the room!"</p>

<p>He advanced towards Ben as he spoke. Ben
thought a moment of standing his ground, but there
was something in John's eye that looked threatening,
and he concluded that it would be the best policy to
obey. With a parting taunt he backed out of the
chamber, and John was left to himself.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">BEN BRAYTON'S RIDE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John</span> took his place at the supper-table as usual;
but neither Mrs. Oakley nor Ben, though they spoke
freely to each other, had a word to say to him. If
John had been conscious of deserving such neglect,
he would have felt disturbed; but as he felt that all
the blame for what had occurred rested with Ben and
his mother, he ate with his usual appetite, and did
not appear in the least troubled by their silence, nor
by the scornful looks which from time to time Mrs.
Oakley directed towards him. After supper he went
up into his little room, and prepared his lesson in
Virgil for the next day. He was at the head of his
class, and was resolved to let no troubles at home
interfere with his faithful preparation of his lessons.</p>

<p>Ben did not attend school. In fact, he was not
very partial to study, and though Squire Oakley had
offered to bear his expenses at the academy, and
afterwards at college, Ben had persuaded his mother
that his health was not firm enough to undertake a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
long course of study. While, therefore, John was
occupied daily for several hours at the academy, Ben
had lived like a gentleman of leisure, spending considerable
time at the billiard rooms in the village,
and in lounging on the hotel piazza. He managed
to get through considerable money, but his mother
had always kept him well supplied.</p>

<p>Although he did not wish to go to college himself,
he did not fancy the idea of John's going, since this
would increase the superiority of the latter over him.
He knew very well that a liberal education would
give John a certain position and influence which he
was not likely to attain, and he determined to prevent
his obtaining it. When, therefore, John had
gone to school the next morning, Ben attacked his
mother on the subject.</p>

<p>"Are you going to send John to college, mother?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want him to go."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He'll put on no end of airs if he goes, and turn
up his nose at me, because I don't happen to know so
much about Latin and Greek, and such rigmarole."</p>

<p>"I wish you would make up your mind to go to
college, Ben," said his mother, earnestly, for she was
very ambitious for her son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's of no use, mother. I'm seventeen, and it
would take three years to get ready, and hard study
at that."</p>

<p>"You have studied Latin already."</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything about it. I should
have to begin all over again."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Oakley, reluctantly giving up
the idea, "you might study law without going to
college."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should like to be a lawyer. It's
too hard work."</p>

<p>"You needn't be, but you could go to the Law
School, and study long enough to get a degree. You
would make some aristocratic acquaintances, and
it would be an honorable profession to belong to."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ben, "I don't know but I'll enter
the Law School in a year, or two. There is no hurry.
I suppose you'll give me enough money so that I
won't have to earn my living? I say, mother, how
much property did old Oakley leave?"</p>

<p>Considering the obligations under which Mrs.
Oakley was placed to her late husband it might have
been supposed that she would reprove Ben for the
disrespectful manner in which he spoke of him; but,
as may be guessed, she cared nothing for her husband,
except for what she could get out of him, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
not in the least disturbed by the manner in which
Ben referred to him.</p>

<p>"This house and the land around it," she said,
"are estimated at ten thousand dollars. There are,
besides, stocks, bonds, and mortgages to the amount
of fifty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Sixty thousand dollars in all!" exclaimed Ben,
his eyes sparkling. "You're quite a rich woman,
mother."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Oakley, complacently, "I suppose
I am."</p>

<p>"It's a little different from when you came here
four years ago on a salary of twenty dollars a month.
You were pretty hard up, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ben, but we can hold up our heads with
anybody now."</p>

<p>"I say, mother," said Ben, persuasively, "as I'm
your only son, I think you might give me ten
thousand dollars right out. You'd have fifty thousand
left."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley shook her head.</p>

<p>"You're too young, Ben," she said. "Some time
or other you shall be well provided for."</p>

<p>"I'm seventeen," grumbled Ben. "I'm old enough
to look after property."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, Ben," said Mrs. Oakley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"I will give you an allowance of ten dollars a week
from now till you are twenty-one. Then, if you behave
well, I will make over to you twenty thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"You might say thirty. You're not saving a third
for John Oakley, are you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley's face hardened.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "he's been too insolent to me. I
suppose I must give him something, but he shall
never have a third."</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars will be enough for him,"
said Ben, with contemptible meanness, considering
that but for the accident of his father's second
marriage the whole property&mdash;one hundred and
twenty times as much&mdash;would have gone to John.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how much he will get," said Mrs.
Oakley. "It depends on how he behaves. If he
had treated us with greater respect, his chances would
be a great deal better."</p>

<p>"He's a proud upstart!"</p>

<p>"But his pride shall be broken. I'm determined
upon that."</p>

<p>"Then you won't send him to college? That would
make him prouder still. Besides," added Ben, his
habitual meanness suggesting the thought, "it costs
a good deal to keep a fellow at college."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Oakley, "he shan't go to
college."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Ben, his eyes sparkling; "that will
be a bitter pill for him, for he wants to go."</p>

<p>"How soon would he be ready?"</p>

<p>"In about a year."</p>

<p>"You may set your mind at rest on that point.
He shan't go."</p>

<p>"All right, mother. When are you going to pay
me my allowance?" he said, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley took out her purse, and placed a ten-dollar
bill in his hand.</p>

<p>"That's for the first week," she said.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make it fifteen, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, ten must do for the present."</p>

<p>"Are you going to allow John anything?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't deserve anything. When he does,
I will allow him fifty cents a week."</p>

<p>Ben strolled over to the billiard rooms, and spent
the forenoon playing billiards with another young
fellow as idle and unpromising as himself. He then
walked over to the hotel, and bought a dozen cigars,
one of which he began to smoke. At one o'clock he
returned home to dinner. John was not present at
this meal. The intermission between morning and
afternoon schools at the academy was but an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and he had been accustomed to carry his lunch with
him. He was not released until four o'clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Ben, "how about the horse?
Are you going to give up to John?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; you may consider the horse
yours," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"John'll make a fuss."</p>

<p>"Let him," said Mrs. Oakley. "He'll find that
I can make a fuss too."</p>

<p>"I'll go out to ride this afternoon," said Ben,
with satisfaction. "I'll get started just before four
o'clock, so as to meet John on his way from school.
He'll look mad enough when he sees me;" and Ben
laughed, as he fancied John's looks.</p>

<p>"It is a very good plan," said Mrs. Oakley, approvingly.
"We'll see if he dares to interfere with
you again."</p>

<p>The more Ben thought of it, the better he was
pleased with this plan. All the academy boys knew
that the horse was John's, and they would now see
him upon it. He would be likely to meet many of
them, and this would make John's humiliation the
greater. At half-past three he went out to the barn.</p>

<p>"Mike," he said, to the hostler, "you may saddle
Prince. I am going to ride out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Master John's horse?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>my</i> horse."</p>

<p>"Your horse, sir? Prince belongs to Master
John."</p>

<p>"How dare you stand there contradicting me?"
said Ben, haughtily. "The horse is mine. My
mother has given it to me."</p>

<p>"It's a shame, then," said Mike to himself, "for
Master John sets a sight by that horse. The old
woman's mighty queer."</p>

<p>It was lucky for Mike that Mrs. Oakley was not
aware of the disrespectful term applied to her in
Mike's thoughts, or he would probably have been
discharged at short notice. But the fact was, that
none of the servants liked her. Feeling a little
doubtful of her own position, she always spoke to
them in a haughty tone, as if they were far beneath
her, and this, instead of increasing their respect, only
diminished it.</p>

<p>Mike saddled Prince, and led him out into the
yard.</p>

<p>"You must be careful, Master Ben," he said.
"The horse has got a spirit of his own, and he isn't
used to you."</p>

<p>Ben was a poor horseman, and he knew it; but he
was too proud to admit it to Mike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself," he said, haughtily. "If
John can manage him, I can."</p>

<p>"He's used to Master John."</p>

<p>"Well, he's got to get used to me," said Ben.
"If he don't behave well it will be the worse for him.
You haven't given me the whip."</p>

<p>"You'd better not use it much, Master Ben. He
won't stand a whip very well."</p>

<p>"Keep your advice till it is asked for," said Ben.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said Mike, and handed him the
whip. He followed him with his eyes as he rode out
of the yard. "He don't sit like Master John. It
wouldn't take much to throw him off. However, I've
warned him, and he must have his own way if he
breaks his neck."</p>

<p>Although Ben had spurned Mike's warning with so
much disdain, he thought of it as he rode up the
street, and let Prince take his own gait. The truth
was, he did not feel very secure in his seat, and did
not feel very much confidence in his own horsemanship.
Indeed, he would not have cared to ride out
this afternoon, but for the anticipated pleasure of
mortifying John.</p>

<p>He rode leisurely along, taking the direction of the
academy, which was nearly a mile distant. He
looked at his watch, and estimated that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
meet the pupils of the academy as they emerged
from school.</p>

<p>He was right in his reckoning. At precisely four
o'clock there was a bustle about the doors, and with
merry shouts the boys poured out into the street.
Among them were John Oakley and Sam Selwyn,
who, as intimate friends and classmates, generally
were found in company. They turned up the street
which led by Mr. Selwyn's office, and in the direction
of John Oakley's home.</p>

<p>"John," said Sam, suddenly, "I do believe that is
Ben Brayton riding on your horse."</p>

<p>John looked up the street, and saw that Sam was
right.</p>

<p>"You are right, Sam," he said.</p>

<p>"Did you tell him he might ride on it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then what business has he with it?"</p>

<p>"His mother told him he might take it. She has
taken it from me."</p>

<p>"She's an old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call names, Sam. I'll tell you more about
it another time."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ben had seen the boys coming from the
academy. Among others he recognized John and
Sam, and his eyes flashed with anticipated triumph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Hitherto he had been content to let the horse go on
at his own rate, but now he thought it was time to
make a display. He thought it would annoy John to
have him dash by at gallant speed, while he, the
rightful owner, was obliged to stand out of the path,
unable to interfere. He therefore brought the whip
down with considerable emphasis upon Prince's side.
Unfortunately he had not foreseen the consequences of
the blow. Prince took the bit between his teeth, and
darted forward with reckless speed, while Ben, seeing
his mistake too late, pale and terrified, threw his arms
around the horse's neck, and tried to keep his seat.</p>

<p>John started forward, also in alarm, for though he
had no reason to like Ben, he did not want him to be
hurt, and called "Prince!"</p>

<p>The horse recognized his master's voice, and
stopped suddenly,&mdash;so suddenly that Ben was
thrown off, and landed in a puddle of standing water
in a gully by the side of the road. Prince stopped
quietly for his master to come up.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Ben?" asked John, hurrying up.</p>

<p>Ben rose from the puddle in sorry plight. He was
only a little bruised, but he was drenched from head
to foot with dirty water, and patches of yellow mud
adhered to his clothes.</p>

<p>"You did this!" he said, furiously to John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are entirely mistaken. I hope you are not
hurt," said John, calmly.</p>

<p>"You frightened the horse on purpose."</p>

<p>"That's a lie, Ben," said Sam, indignantly. "It's
a lie, and you know it."</p>

<p>"I understand it all. You don't deceive me,"
said Ben, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Will you ride home?" asked John.</p>

<p>Ben refused. In fact, he was afraid to trust himself
again on Prince's back.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I must." And John sprang
lightly upon the horse's back, and rode towards home,
followed by Ben in his soiled clothes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley, looking from her window, beheld,
with wondering anger, John riding into the yard, and
her son following in his soiled clothes.</p>

<p>"What's he been doing to Ben?" she thought,
and hurried downstairs in a furious rage.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">BEN IS COMFORTED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"What</span> have you been doing to my son, you young
reprobate?" demanded Mrs. Oakley of John. Her
hands trembled convulsively with passion, as if she
would like to get hold of our hero, and avenge Ben's
wrongs by inflicting punishment on the spot.</p>

<p>John was silent.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak, you young rascal?" demanded
Mrs. Oakley, furiously.</p>

<p>"I am neither a reprobate nor a rascal, Mrs.
Oakley," said John, calmly, "and I do not choose to
answer when addressed in that way."</p>

<p>"Ben," said Mrs. Oakley, turning to her son,
"what has he done to you? How happens it that
you come home in such a plight?"</p>

<p>"I was thrown over the horse's head into a mud-puddle,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"Didn't <i>he</i> have anything to do with it?" asked
Mrs. Oakley, determined to connect John with Ben's
misfortune, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"He spoke to the horse," said Ben.</p>

<p>"And then he threw you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ben answered thus, being perfectly willing that his
mother should charge his fall upon John, as this would
create additional prejudice between them. It was
contemptible meanness on his part, but meanness
was characteristic of him, and he had no hesitation
in stooping to falsehood, direct or indirect, if by so
doing he could compass his object.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," said Mrs. Oakley, thinking it
unnecessary to inquire further. "Of course, as soon
as you were thrown, he jumped on the horse and rode
home. You're carrying matters with a high hand,
young man; but you'll find that I'm your match. Get
off that horse, directly."</p>

<p>"That was my intention," said John. "I am
sorry, Mrs. Oakley," he continued, "that Ben has
not seen fit to give you a correct account of what has
happened. If he had, it would have been unnecessary
for me to speak."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary for you to speak now, John
Oakley," said his stepmother, sharply. "Do you
mean to charge my son with telling a falsehood? If
that is the case, take care what you say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ben has not told a falsehood, but he is trying to
make you believe that I caused his fall."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you did."</p>

<p>"Then you are mistaken. Why didn't he tell you
that when I first saw the horse he was running at
great speed, in consequence of Ben's having imprudently
struck him severely with the whip? He is a
spirited horse, and won't stand the whip."</p>

<p>"He is like you in that, I suppose," said Mrs.
Oakley, sneering.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> like me in that," said John, quietly.</p>

<p>"You would both be better if you had to stand it,"
said his stepmother, angrily.</p>

<p>John did not see fit to reply to this.</p>

<p>"Is this true, Ben?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ben, reluctantly. "I struck the
horse; but it was not till John spoke to him that he
threw me off."</p>

<p>"So I supposed," said Mrs. Oakley, significantly.</p>

<p>"I see, Mrs. Oakley," said John, "you are determined
to find me guilty of causing Ben's fall. If I
could be mean enough to do such a thing, and so risk
his life, I should despise myself. Prince was rushing
up the street with tremendous speed, and I was
frightened at Ben's danger; I called out to Prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
but he stopped so suddenly that Ben was thrown into
the puddle, or he might have been seriously hurt."</p>

<p>There was so much sincerity in what John said,
that Mrs. Oakley, though very much against her will,
could hardly help believing him. Determined, however,
to make out a case against him, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As soon as you saw him off, you jumped on the
horse and rode home, leaving him to get home as he
could. That was a very generous and noble thing to
do!"</p>

<p>"Ask Ben if I did not ask him to ride home,"
said John.</p>

<p>Ben, in answer to his mother's glance, said, rather
unwillingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, he asked me to ride home, but he knew I
wouldn't after being thrown once. I won't get on
the brute's back again, I promise you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley was disappointed to find that the case
she was trying to make out against John had failed
at all points, and that he was cleared even by the
testimony of her principal witness.</p>

<p>"You had better come in and change your clothes,
Ben," she said. "I am afraid you will take cold.
And do you"&mdash;turning to John&mdash;"take the horse
round to the stable. He's an ugly brute, and I'll take
care that he doesn't endanger your life any more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>John led Prince round to the stable, and delivered
him into the hands of Mike.</p>

<p>"Where's Master Ben?" inquired Mike.</p>

<p>"He got thrown off."</p>

<p>"I thought how it would be," said Mike. "He
can't ride no more'n a stick. I told him not to take
the whip, but he wouldn't heed a word I said."</p>

<p>"That's how he got thrown. He struck the horse
violently, and he was running away with him when
he heard my voice and stopped."</p>

<p>"Did Master Ben get hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not much. He fell into a puddle, and dirtied
his clothes."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll be wiser next time."</p>

<p>"He says he won't ride Prince again."</p>

<p>"All the better for you, Master John."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mike," said John, soberly. "I'm
afraid Mrs. Oakley will sell him. She says he is an
ugly brute, and she won't have any more lives endangered."</p>

<p>"Ugly brute!" repeated Mike, indignantly.
"There's not a bit of ugliness about him. He wants
to be treated well, and I'd like to know who don't.
And he's so attached to you, Master John!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mike, it'll be hard to part with him." And
John's lips quivered as he looked with affection at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
noble horse, to which he had become much attached.
Besides, it was his father's gift, and as such had an
additional value for him, as, owing to his disinheritance,
he had nothing else of value by which he could
remember the parent whose loss he was made to feel
more and more, as his stepmother's injustice and
harsh treatment, and Ben's meanness and hostility
served daily to increase. It almost seemed to him
as if Prince was the only friend he had left, and that
he must be parted even from him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ben was changing his clothes in his
room. The adventure which had just happened to
him did not make him feel very pleasant. In the
first place, it is rather disagreeable to be thrown violently
into a puddle of dirty water, and Ben might
be excused for not liking that. Ben's pride was
touched, since it had been demonstrated in the most
public manner that he could not manage Prince,
while it was well known that John could. Ben knew
boys well enough to feel sure that he would be reminded
from time to time of his adventure, and he did
not like to be laughed at. Why was it that John always
seemed to get the better of him? He went out expressly
to triumph over John in presence of his schoolmates,
and this had been the humiliating result.</p>

<p>"Why was I such a fool as to use the whip?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thought Ben, vexed with himself. "If it had not
been for that, it would have been all right."</p>

<p>But he had used the whip, and it was all wrong.
As to using the horse any more, he did not care to do
it. To tell the truth, Ben, who, as we know, was not
very courageous, was afraid of Prince. He suspected
that the horse would remember the blow he
had given him, and would be likely to serve him the
same trick the next time he mounted him. So he resolved
that he would never ride out on Prince again;
but he was equally anxious that John should also be
prevented from using him. The words that his
mother had last used led him to hope that she would
agree to sell him, and, what was still more important
in his eyes, <i>give him the money</i> resulting from the sale.
Under these circumstances the triumph would still be
his, and he would enjoy John's grief for the loss of
his horse.</p>

<p>When Ben descended from his chamber, in a clean
suit, he found that his mother had taken measures to
console him for his mortifying adventure. The tea-table
was spread, and two or three delicacies such as
he particularly liked were set before his plate. Ben
surveyed this with satisfaction, for he was something
of a gourmand.</p>

<p>"I thought you might be hungry, Ben," said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mother; "so I got some of that marmalade that
you like so well, and here is some hot mince-pie."</p>

<p>"That's just what I like, mother."</p>

<p>"We will sit down at once. John can come when
he gets ready."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about that horse,
mother?" asked Ben, rather indistinctly, for his
mouth was full.</p>

<p>"I did intend to keep him for your use; but if he
is likely to play such tricks as he has to-day, I suppose
I had better sell him."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, sell him. I'll never mount such a
vicious brute again, and I suppose you won't keep him
just for John's use."</p>

<p>"Of course not. It costs considerable to keep a
horse. Besides, he'd be flinging out that he could
manage the horse, and you couldn't."</p>

<p>"Of course he would. But the horse is used to
him, you know, and that is why he doesn't find any
trouble with him. But you gave me the horse, you
know, mother."</p>

<p>"But you don't want him."</p>

<p>"No, I don't; but I suppose you'll give me the
money you sell him for."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Mrs. Oakley, hesitatingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
"He cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
That is too much money for you to have."</p>

<p>"Why is it?" said Ben.</p>

<p>"I give you ten dollars a week now."</p>

<p>"Yes; but that goes for small expenses. If I
wanted now to buy anything expensive, I couldn't do
it."</p>

<p>"What is there you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," said Ben; "I haven't thought,
but I should like to have the money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley still hesitated.</p>

<p>"I know it would make John awful mad," said
Ben, cunningly appealing to his mother's hatred of
our hero, "to think that Prince was sold, and that
I had the money. Perhaps it's that you're thinking
of. But I didn't suppose you'd be influenced by anything
he could say or do."</p>

<p>"John may be angry or not; it is entirely indifferent
to me," said Mrs. Oakley, falling into the trap
laid for her. "I was only thinking whether it would
be well for you. I don't know but I will let you
have the money,&mdash;that is, I will put it in the savings-bank
in your name, and you can let me know when
you want to use it, and what for."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ben, who determined that when
he once got hold of the money he would not consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
anybody as to its disposal. "When will you sell it,
mother?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, perhaps. I hear that Mr. Barnes,
the livery stable-keeper, has just lost a valuable
horse. Perhaps he may like to buy it."</p>

<p>"He'll buy it fast enough," said Ben. "I heard
him say the other day that he should like to have
Prince. He likes fast horses. How surprised John
will be when he comes home, and finds Prince is
missing!"</p>

<p>Ben laughed as he fancied John's anger, and this
thought, together with the money which would so
soon be placed to his account, quite restored his
spirits, somewhat to John's surprise, who did not understand
the reasons which he had for being cheerful.</p>

<p>So Prince's fate was decided, and a new trial
awaited John.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">OPEN HOSTILITIES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> his early boyhood John had been intended
by his father to receive a collegiate education. If he
should acquit himself with credit in college, he was
afterwards to have his choice of studying a profession,
or entering mercantile life. At the age of eleven he
commenced Latin at the academy, and two years
afterwards Greek, and in these he had advanced so
far that in a year he would be qualified to enter college.
There were six boys in the preparatory class to
which he belonged, among them being Sam Selwyn,
his intimate friend, who has already been introduced
to the reader. From the first John had stood at the
head of the class, both in Latin and Greek, Sam ranking
second. Although they were rivals in scholarship,
there had never been the shadow of a difference between
them arising from this cause. Both were of a
generous nature, and were strongly attached to each
other, and it had long been understood between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that when admitted to college they would room
together.</p>

<p>John had often talked with his father about going
to college, and Squire Oakley had strong hopes of
John's maintaining a high position in his college class,
and doing him credit at the institution where he had
himself graduated. This made it all the more remarkable
that John's interests had been so entirely
neglected in the disposition of his property made by
his will.</p>

<p>As John was on his way to school, on the morning
succeeding Ben's fall from the horse, he was overtaken
by Sam Selwyn.</p>

<p>"How's your amiable brother this morning, John?"
asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Meaning Ben?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I hope his health hasn't suffered
seriously from his unexpected bath. Poor fellow! he
had a pretty good fright."</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't think he'll trouble Prince very soon
again."</p>

<p>"I shan't soon forget how frightened he looked
with both arms around the horse's neck. I should
have felt like laughing, only I was afraid he might
come to harm. Now you'll have Prince to yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Sam. I rather think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from something Mrs. Oakley said, that she means to
sell Prince."</p>

<p>"Sell <i>your</i> horse!" exclaimed Sam, indignantly.</p>

<p>"She says it isn't mine. She's given it to Ben.
As Ben don't dare to use it, I am afraid Prince will
have to go," said John, sadly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stand it!" exclaimed Sam, in excitement.
"It's an imposition."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?"</p>

<p>"The horse is yours."</p>

<p>"Not legally, I am afraid. I can't prove it, and
Mrs. Oakley says it was only mine to use."</p>

<p>"Whether you can prove it or not, the horse is
yours, and I say it will be an outrageous thing if it is
sold. At any rate you ought to demand the money
that is received for it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I have made up my mind to do.
Mrs. Oakley may say that the horse is expensive to
keep, but as Ben received a watch and chain at the
same time I got the horse, it is only fair that I should
have a watch in place of it, if it is sold."</p>

<p>"Of course, that is only reasonable."</p>

<p>"Not that a watch would pay me for the loss of
Prince. I'd rather have him than three watches; but
it doesn't cost anything to keep a watch."</p>

<p>"That's true; but I hope you'll be able to keep the
horse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I," said John; but he had very little expectation
of it.</p>

<p>"Well, there's hope ahead, old fellow," said Sam,
cheerfully. "Next year we'll enter college, and then
you'll be out of the way of Master Ben and your
kind stepmother, for forty weeks in the year, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said John, slowly.</p>

<p>"You <i>hope so</i>?" repeated Sam. "You don't expect
Mrs. Oakley will remove to Cambridge, so that
you may still be favored with her charming company?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel sure of going to Cambridge myself,"
said John, soberly.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you're afraid you won't
pass the examination? If you don't, there'll be precious
little chance for the rest of us."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean," said John. "I think
I should pass the examination. At any rate I am not
afraid of it."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you afraid of then?" asked Sam, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"I am afraid Mrs. Oakley won't let me go."</p>

<p>"But your father always meant you to go. She
knows that."</p>

<p>"Yes, she knows it, for father used often to refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the time when I would be in college, in her presence.
But I am afraid that won't make much difference
with her."</p>

<p>"Has she said anything about it?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet; but it will cost considerable to keep
me at Cambridge."</p>

<p>"Well, your father left a good deal of property."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it was left to Mrs. Oakley."</p>

<p>"There's enough to pay your expenses at college,
and maintain Mrs. Oakley and Ben handsomely."</p>

<p>"I know that, but I am sorry to say that Mrs.
Oakley and Ben both dislike me, and it will be reason
enough with them to keep me at home because they
know I am anxious to go."</p>

<p>"It's a burning shame," said Sam, indignantly,
"that such a woman as that should have the control
over you. As for Ben Brayton, I always did despise
him. He's a mean fellow, and a coward to boot."</p>

<p>"I don't like Ben much," said John.</p>

<p>"And he returns the compliment."</p>

<p>"Yes, he has taken a dislike to me, I don't know
why, for I have always treated him well, though I
couldn't like him."</p>

<p>"I say, John," said Sam, "if you don't go to college,
it'll knock all my plans into a cocked hat. You
were to room with me, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Sam, I have been looking forward to that a
long time."</p>

<p>"What a jolly time we should have! I shan't
have half so much pleasure in going to college if you
don't go with me. You're such a good scholar, too,
it would be a great pity. But perhaps it may not be
so bad as you think. Mrs. Oakley may be only too
glad to get rid of you."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of the academy.
The bell sounded, summoning the pupils to
their morning exercises, and John and Sam had other
things to think of, for a while at least.</p>

<p>At the close of the afternoon John returned home.
He went into the house to carry his Virgil and Greek
Reader, being accustomed to prepare a part of his
lessons out of school. On going out into the yard,
he saw Ben lounging lazily against a fence, whittling.</p>

<p>"Are you going out to ride, John?" he asked, in
an unusually friendly tone.</p>

<p>"I think I will ride a little way," said John.</p>

<p>"I got enough of it yesterday," said Ben.</p>

<p>"You were unlucky. If you had not struck Prince
it would have been all right."</p>

<p>"I don't care about trying it again. I hope you'll
have a pleasant ride."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John, unsuspiciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He went out to the barn, and opened the door that
led to the stables. He made his way at once to
Prince's stall, and looked in.</p>

<p><i>It was empty!</i></p>

<p>Surprised, but not yet suspecting what had really
happened, he called out to Mike, whom he saw outside:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where's Prince, Mike?"</p>

<p>"Shure, sir, didn't you know he was sold?"</p>

<p>"Sold? When?"</p>

<p>"This morning, Master John."</p>

<p>"Who bought him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Barnes, the man that keeps the livery stable.
He was here this morning. He and the mistress
came in, and they soon struck a bargain."</p>

<p>John's heart swelled with anger and sorrow, but he
asked, calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know what price Mr. Barnes gave for
Prince?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master John; I heard him say that he would
give one hundred and ninety dollars. The mistress
wanted two hundred; but she finally let him have
Prince at that, and a good bargain it is to him too."</p>

<p>John left the stable outwardly calm, but much disturbed
in mind.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oakley might at least have let me know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
what she meant to do," he said, bitterly. "My poor
father's gift too."</p>

<p>Ben waited for John's return with malicious interest.
He wanted to witness and enjoy his disappointment.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to ride?" he said, with
a smile of mockery.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where your mother is?" asked
John, coldly.</p>

<p>"She's in the house, I suppose. Do you want to
see her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>John entered the house without taking any further
notice of Ben. He found his stepmother in the sitting-room.
She looked up, as he entered, with a
glance of satisfaction, for she saw that she had made
him unhappy.</p>

<p>"Mike tells me you have sold Prince, Mrs. Oakley,"
he commenced.</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"As he was my horse, I think you might have let
me know what you intended to do."</p>

<p>"Prince was not your horse," she said, sharply.</p>

<p>"He was my poor father's gift to me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He merely let you call him yours.
The horse was mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was as much mine as Ben's watch is his.
Are you going to sell Ben's watch?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not. If that is all you have to say, you
may leave the room."</p>

<p>"It is not. I will not object to your selling the
horse, because it would cost something to keep him;
but it is only fair that the money for which he was
sold should be given to me, or enough to buy a watch
and chain like Ben's."</p>

<p>"You are very modest in your expectations, young
man," sneered Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I'm only asking what is just."</p>

<p>"You seem to forget whom you are speaking to.
If you think you can bully me, you will find yourself
entirely mistaken."</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of bullying anybody. I
only want my rights," said John.</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to want. You may as well understand,
first as last, John Oakley,"&mdash;and his stepmother
raised her voice angrily,&mdash;"that I am mistress
in this house, and owner of this property. You are
entirely dependent upon me for the bread you eat and
the clothes you wear, and it will be prudent for you
to treat me respectfully, if you want any favors. Do
you understand that?"</p>

<p>"I understand what you say, Mrs. Oakley," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
John, indignantly. "You seem to have forgotten that
every cent of this property belonged to my father, and
would now be mine, if my father had not married you.
You had better remember <i>that</i>, when you talk about
my being dependent upon you, and favor Ben at my
expense."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley turned white with rage.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your impertinence, you
young rascal?" she shrieked, rising to her feet, and
glaring at John.</p>

<p>"I mean this," he exclaimed, thoroughly provoked,
"that I don't believe my father ever intended to
leave you all his property. I believe there is another
will somewhere, and I mean to find it."</p>

<p>"Leave the room!" exclaimed Mrs. Oakley, in a
voice almost inarticulate with rage. "You'll repent
those words, John Oakley. You're in my power, and
I'll make you feel it."</p>

<p>John left the room, his anger hot within him.
When he reflected coolly upon what had passed, he
did repent having spoken about the will. It might set
Mrs. Oakley upon the track, and if she found it, he
feared that she would have no scruples in destroying
it, and then his last chance of obtaining his rights
would be gone.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MRS. OAKLEY DECIDES WHAT TO DO.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Oakley</span> was not only angry, but very much
disturbed at the words which John had imprudently
uttered. They startled her, because they intimated
John's suspicion of something which she had good
reason for knowing to be a fact.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley knew that her husband had executed
a later will, and, though she did not know where it
was, she believed it still to be in existence!</p>

<p>The will under which she inherited bore a date
only two months after her marriage with Squire Oakley.
She had cunningly influenced him to make it.
He did so without proper consideration, and gave the
will into her custody. But, though his wife carefully
concealed from him her real character, she could not
do so entirely. Little things, which came under his
observation, led him to believe that she entertained
a secret dislike for John, and, only three months
before his death, Squire Oakley, to protect John's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
interests, made a second will, which superseded the
first, and limited his wife to that portion of his property
which she could legally claim,&mdash;that is, one
third.</p>

<p>He did not see fit to apprise his wife of this step.
But she was watchful and observant, and something
led her to suspect what had been done. She determined
to find out secretly, and with this end went to
the desk where her husband kept his private papers,
one day when she supposed him to be absent, and
began to search for the suspected will. After a while
she found it, and, spreading it open, began to read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, Henry Oakley, being of sound mind," etc.</p>

<p>She had read so far, when a heavy hand was laid
upon her shoulder. Turning with a start, she saw her
husband, his face dark with anger, looking sternly at
her.</p>

<p>"Give me that document, Mrs. Oakley," he said,
abruptly.</p>

<p>She did not dare do otherwise than obey.</p>

<p>"By what right do you come here to pry into my
private papers?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am your wife," she said.</p>

<p>"That is true. You are my wife; but that does
not authorize your stealing in here like a thief,
and secretly examining papers, which would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
been shown you if they had been intended for your
eyes."</p>

<p>"Does not that paper relate to me?" she asked,
boldly.</p>

<p>"It relates to my property."</p>

<p>"It is your will."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And it makes the one which I hold of no value."</p>

<p>"It does."</p>

<p>"So you are secretly plotting against my interests,"
she said, angrily. "I suspected as much, and
I determined to find out."</p>

<p>"The will of which you speak never ought to have
been made. It disinherits my son, and places him
in your power."</p>

<p>"Could you not trust me to provide for him?"
asked Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I fear not," said her husband. And her eyes fell
before his steady glance. She felt that she was better
understood than she had supposed.</p>

<p>"So you have placed me in John's power," she
said, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"Have you not left the property to him?"</p>

<p>"You well know that you are entitled by law to
one-third of my estate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"One-third!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he is to have two-thirds?"</p>

<p>"Why should he not? If I had not married a second
time he would have had the whole."</p>

<p>"And my son Ben is left unprovided for?" questioned
Mrs. Oakley, in a tone of mingled anger and
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Ben has no claim upon me."</p>

<p>"Poor boy! so he will be penniless."</p>

<p>"You appear to forget that your share of the
property will amount to twenty thousand dollars.
He need not suffer, unless his mother should refuse
to provide for him."</p>

<p>But this did not suit Mrs. Oakley's views. She
was not at all reconciled to the thought that John
Oakley, whom she disliked, would inherit forty thousand
dollars, while she and Ben must live on half that
sum. She was fond of money and the position it
would bring, and although twenty thousand dollars
would once have seemed to her a great fortune, her
desires had increased with her prosperity, and she now
thought it a hardship that she should be limited to
such a trifle. She was by no means reconciled to the
thought that Ben must play second fiddle to his rich
stepbrother. Still John was young, and if she were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his guardian that would be something. So she
smoothed her face and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you have appointed me John's
guardian?"</p>

<p>Squire Oakley shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have appointed Mr. Selwyn to that position.
It is more fitting that a lawyer should have the care
of property," he said.</p>

<p>There was another reason which he did not mention.
He thought that John's interests would be
safer in Mr. Selwyn's hands than in those of his
wife.</p>

<p>"This is an insult to me," said Mrs. Oakley, angry
and disappointed. "It will be declaring to the
world that you have no confidence in me."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. Even were you his real
mother, there would be nothing strange in my leaving
him to the guardianship of another."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Oakley looked angry, and for days
afterwards wore an offended and injured look. She
appeared to forget from what poverty and dependence
Squire Oakley had delivered her, and how many
favors he had lavished upon Ben, who had no claim
upon him save in his relationship to her.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, Squire Oakley asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wife for the will which she had had in her possession
for nearly three years.</p>

<p>"Why do you want it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because it is of no value now, since I have made
a later will. I wish to destroy it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley said she would look for it. If she
did so, she took care not to look in the right place,
for she reported that it was mislaid, and she could
not find it.</p>

<p>"It is rather strange that you should have mislaid
a document which might have been of such importance,"
said Squire Oakley, significantly.</p>

<p>"I am always mislaying things," said she, forcing
a laugh. "I will look again to-morrow."</p>

<p>But the will was not found, and Squire Oakley drew
his own deductions from this fact. Painful as it was
to suspect his wife, he feared that his second will
would not be safe if she could once get it into her
possession. He saw, too late, that he had married a
selfish and unscrupulous woman. He determined,
therefore, to conceal the document, which so vitally
affected his son's interests, in a hiding-place where it
would be safe from Mrs. Oakley's prying disposition.
He did so. But he did not foresee at that time how
soon he would be struck with paralysis that would
affect his speech, and render it difficult for him to reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the secret to those who ought to know it. So
it happened, however. From the time paralysis attacked
him, Mrs. Oakley kept vigilant watch over
him, and did all she could to keep John away from
his father's bedside, lest the secret should be revealed
to him. Meanwhile, she sought everywhere for the
missing will, but couldn't find it. The most she
feared was that it had been placed in the lawyer's
hands for safe-keeping. It ought to have been.
Squire Oakley, as he lay on his sick-bed, regretted
bitterly that it had not been so disposed of. It would
have saved him from much anxiety. John obtained
one interview with him, as we know, but his father
was unable to impart to him the desired information,
and the sudden entrance of Mrs. Oakley destroyed
his last chance.</p>

<p>The rest we know. Squire Oakley died; his wife
produced the earlier will, which she now had no difficulty
in finding, and under that claimed and inherited
the whole property. A search was instituted for the
late will, under the lawyer's directions, but it was
not found. Mrs. Oakley found herself, to her secret
delight, the undisputed mistress of her late husband's
handsome estate. She had hoped that John knew
nothing of the later will; but the words to which he
gave utterance at the close of the last chapter undeceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her. It was clear that he knew something of
it, and he had expressed a determination to find it.
That it was somewhere in the house, Mrs. Oakley believed,
and, if so, it was very possible that John might
stumble upon it. The result would be that she would
be compelled to surrender two-thirds of the property,
and he would become independent of her. Aside
from the large pecuniary loss, she could not bear to
think of John's release from her persecutions. At
present, she pleased herself with thinking that he was
in her power, and that she could "break his proud
spirit," as she termed it, though, as we have seen,
John was disposed to be respectful, and only displayed
such a proper spirit as his self-respect demanded.</p>

<p>"If I could only find the will myself," thought
Mrs. Oakley, "there would be no further trouble."</p>

<p>She did not say to herself, that, should such a discovery
be made, it would plainly be her duty to make
it known to Squire Selwyn, who had always been her
late husband's lawyer. She did not consider what
she should do with it, but we who have obtained a
glimpse of her character may easily guess that in her
hands it would not have benefited John much.</p>

<p>The point for Mrs. Oakley to consider was how to
protect herself against any sudden discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
John's. She saw that it would be dangerous for her
to have him continue in the house, and she resolved
to send him away. Where, she could not at once
decide.</p>

<p>Having determined upon this, it occurred to her
once more to visit her husband's desk, and examine
it carefully, in the hope of discovering some secret
drawer, in which the will might have been concealed.</p>

<p>It was now evening. She lit a lamp, and went to
the small room which Squire Oakley had used for
reading and writing in, and went at once to the desk.
It was old-fashioned, with a variety of small drawers.
These she had examined more than once, but she
opened them again, in the hope of discovering some
false bottom, which had served as a means of concealment.
While she was intent upon her search, she
heard a slight noise at the door, and, looking up, was
startled to find John looking into the room.</p>

<p>"What are you prying into my actions for?" she
demanded, sharply, a little embarrassed at being
caught thus employed, and especially by John.</p>

<p>"I am not," said John.</p>

<p>"Why are you here, then?"</p>

<p>"By accident entirely; I was passing through the
entry, and, seeing a light in here, I just glanced in."</p>

<p>"I wanted to find a receipt," said Mrs. Oakley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thinking it best to offer some plausible explanation.
"A bill was presented me for payment that I think
has already been paid."</p>

<p>"Can I assist you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Oakley, coldly. "I shall probably
find it soon."</p>

<p>John was not deceived by this explanation. He
felt sure that Mrs. Oakley was searching for the will;
but this he kept to himself.</p>

<p>"I must get rid of him at once," said his stepmother.
"Once get him out of the house, and I'll
explore it thoroughly. I shan't feel safe till the will
is found."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MR. EPHRAIM HUXTER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Oakley</span> had determined to send John away,
This resolution was easily formed, but it was not
quite so easy to decide where to send him. There
were plenty of boarding-schools where he might be
sent, but these would be expensive, and, besides, Mrs.
Oakley was of opinion that John knew enough
already. He was very much the superior of Ben in
scholarship, and for this she was sorry. She would
like to have apprenticed him to a trade; but if this
was done while Ben lived in idleness, Mr. Selwyn
would be sure to remonstrate, and as the will was not
yet found she felt in some fear of his opinion.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the stage arrived one
afternoon before the gate, and a tall, shabbily
dressed man, with a battered valise, descended, and
walking up the front path rang the bell.</p>

<p>The servant who answered the summons thought
she recognized him as a peddler who had called there
about a month before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"We don't want anything," she said, abruptly,
nearly shutting the door in the stranger's face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded, staring at
her in surprise. "I want to see your mistress."</p>

<p>"It's no use. She won't take anything of you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your impudence?" he
said, angrily.</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity," said the girl. "You put on airs
enough for a peddler; but it's of no use. You may
take your rubbish off somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Who's a peddler, I should like to know? If you
don't open that door pretty quick, I'll tell my sister
to dismiss you without a character."</p>

<p>"Your sister!" repeated the girl, taken by surprise.
"What has your sister got to do with me?"</p>

<p>"She gives you a home, and pays you wages, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"Aint you a peddler, then?" demanded the girl,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"I am Mrs. Oakley's brother, and you'd better
invite me into the house, if you want to stay in it
yourself."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. I made a mistake. If you'll
walk in I'll tell Mrs. Oakley you're here."</p>

<p>"That's the first sensible word you've spoken.
I'll put my valise here in the entry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," thought the servant, "if that's Mrs.
Oakley's brother, I don't think much of her family.
I always thought she belonged to a poor set."</p>

<p>She went upstairs to the front chamber, where her
mistress liked to sit, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your brother's downstairs. He says he would
like to see you."</p>

<p>"My brother!" repeated her mistress, not looking
overpleased.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is down in the parlor."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will go down and see him."</p>

<p>The ill-dressed stranger was stretched out in a
rocking-chair, in an attitude more comfortable than
graceful. He was gazing about the room, and
noting with much complacency the evidences of
comfort and luxury which the handsome furniture
exhibited. It was thus that Mrs. Oakley found him.</p>

<p>"How do you do, brother Ephraim?" she said,
coldly, advancing, and just giving him the tips of
her fingers.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty well," he answered. "So the old
gentleman's dead, hey?"</p>

<p>"If you mean my husband," she answered, still
with coldness, "you are right."</p>

<p>"It's all right about the property, hey? How
much is left to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"The whole."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Mr. Ephraim Huxter.&mdash;"Well,
you have worked your cards well, that's a
fact."</p>

<p>"I'll thank you, Ephraim," said Mrs. Oakley, with
dignity, "not to use such low language, or indulge
in such insinuations. I did my duty by my husband,
and he showed his confidence in me by leaving me
his property."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps that's the right way to put it,"
said Mr. Huxter. "I'm glad you have feathered
your nest so well."</p>

<p>"I must again request you not to indulge in such
language," said Mrs. Oakley, in tones of displeasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was evidently perplexed.</p>

<p>"Come, Jane," said he, "there's no use in trying
to deceive me. You made a good thing of it in
marrying old Oakley, and you needn't pretend to be
broken-hearted because he is dead, and has left you
his fortune."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Mrs. Oakley, closing the door;
"what if the servants should hear you talking in
this way?"</p>

<p>"Well, there is something in that. That girl of
yours that came to the door took me for a peddler.
She wasn't going to let me in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley glanced at her brother's soiled linen
and stained clothes, and did not express any surprise.</p>

<p>"I brought my valise," said her brother. "I suppose
it'll be convenient for me to stay a few days."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley assented rather ungraciously,&mdash;in
truth she did not care much to present such a man as
her brother. She felt that it would make it still more
difficult to obtain the position which she desired to
maintain in the village.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe I could help you in settling up
the estate," said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall require any assistance.
Mr. Oakley was a good business man, and the task
is an easy one," said his sister, coldly.</p>

<p>"How much does the property amount to?" asked
Mr. Huxter,&mdash;the property being in his eyes the main
thing to be considered.</p>

<p>"I can't say exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, you can give a guess."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Oakley did not care to have her brother
understand her exact position as regarded money
matters. She saw clearly enough that he was already
speculating how to turn her prosperity to his own advantage,
and this she was determined he should not
do. She would like to have kept him at a distance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
she was already feeling one of the inconveniences of
wealth. There are some whose chief enjoyment of
wealth arises from the happiness which it enables
them to impart to others, and some, in Mrs. Oakley's
position, would have been glad to do something for
such of their relatives as were in struggling circumstances;
but it was not so with her. She was of a
stingy, penurious disposition, and did not mean that
her money should benefit any one but Benjamin and
herself, except the small sum which she felt obliged
to spend on John.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I could form any estimate," she
said. "Mr. Oakley has recently died, you know."</p>

<p>"Has he left as much as fifty thousand?"</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand!" exclaimed Mrs. Oakley;
"what are you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"It isn't much less, I am thinking. At any rate,
you're a rich woman."</p>

<p>"I am comfortably provided for."</p>

<p>"I wish I was as comfortably provided for," said
Mr. Huxter. "Seems to me your ideas have risen
some, Jane, since you used to live with me, and bind
shoes for a living. You and Ben wouldn't have been
very comfortable, I reckon, if I hadn't helped you
once upon a time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"As to that," said Mrs. Oakley, "I worked for my
board. It was no great favor on your part."</p>

<p>"At any rate, you thought yourself lucky to get a
home. Now, things are changed considerably. You
are a rich woman, and&mdash;well, I'm hard up."</p>

<p>"You always were shiftless, Ephraim," said Mrs.
Oakley, who saw what her brother was coming to.</p>

<p>"Shiftless!" repeated Mr. Huxter, in an injured
tone. "I don't know what you call shiftless. I've
been a hard-working man; but luck's never been on
my side."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter's nose had a suspicious redness, which
seemed to indicate whiskey might have had something
to do with his want of luck. This was in fact
the case. If he had never made much headway, it
was partly, at least, his own fault, as his sister knew
well enough. But she knew also that there was very
little chance of his amending in that particular, and
though she gave him little encouragement by her
manner, she felt that she should have to help him at
last.</p>

<p>"How are your family?" asked Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Oh, about as usual. Wife's always scoldin' and
complainin', and the children are fractious. I don't
know what makes 'em behave so. My home aint a
very happy one, that's a fact."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley knew that very well. For more than
two years, when left a widow, with Ben on her hands,
she had found a home in her brother's family, which
proved so far from agreeable, that she finally determined
to leave it, and do as well as she could for herself
outside. She had been lucky enough to obtain a
situation in Mr. Oakley's family as house-keeper, and
this proved the starting-point of a new and prosperous
career. During Mr. Oakley's life, Mr. Huxter
had never been near her. This had been at Mrs.
Oakley's special request. She felt that her brother
was not calculated to do her any particular credit,
and she had succeeded, though with some difficulty,
in keeping him at a distance. She had accomplished
this by an occasional present, and the distinct intimation
that these would cease unless her brother should
respect her wishes. Now that she was a widow, he
considered that the prohibition was at an end, and
had presented himself unexpectedly, and was by no
means welcome.</p>

<p>At this moment Ben, who wished to see his mother,
and was not aware of his uncle's arrival, entered the
room, and, observing the shaggy appearance of the
visitor, whom apparently he did not recognize, surveyed
him with unconcealed contempt.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MORE ABOUT MR. HUXTER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ephraim Huxter</span>, on perceiving Ben, wreathed
his homely features into what was intended for a
gracious smile, and, rising, took his nephew's rather
unwilling hand.</p>

<p>"So this is Ben," he said. "Bless me, what a
young gentleman he's grown, to be sure! Don't you
remember me, Ben?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Ben, but not truly, for he had
recognized his uncle at first sight. Indeed, any one
who had ever seen Mr. Huxter would be likely to remember
his harsh features and ungainly form.</p>

<p>"It is your Uncle Ephraim," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Ben, not feeling it necessary to
express any pleasure. With his improved fortunes,
his pride had developed, and he had come to look
upon his mother's brother as a low person, who was
immeasurably his inferior.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ben has become quite a gentleman," said
his uncle, surveying his broadcloth suit, and gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
watch-chain ostentatiously displayed over his vest.
"But I dare say he hasn't forgotten when he used
to run round in a shirt and overalls, and hoed potatoes
at three cents an hour."</p>

<p>Ben did remember distinctly, and the recollection
was far from pleasing; so he thought it best to forget it.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything of the kind," he said,
rather roughly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'd want to be paid better now, ha,
ha!" said Mr. Huxter, laughing as if he thought it a
capital joke.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about hoeing potatoes,"
said Ben, haughtily. "I'm not a laborer."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Mr. Huxter. "You
and your mother are now rich; but I hope you won't
look down on your poor uncle and cousins, who have
to grub along as well as they can for a living. Things
were different once, to be sure. Once my humble
home was thrown open to receive you, and I was
glad to give you a shelter, though a lowly one, in
your hour of need. I shall always be glad to think
of that, though my wife and little ones should starve
before my face."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter deliberately drew from his pocket a
red cotton handkerchief, and raised it to his eyes,
not to wipe away the tears, for there were none, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to increase the pathos of his remarks. But even with
this help they failed to produce the desired effect.
Mrs. Oakley remained cool and unaffected, and Ben,
turning from his uncle to his mother, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How soon will supper be ready?"</p>

<p>"You may go and ask Hannah to set the table at
once," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>Ben left the room with alacrity, without taking
further notice of his uncle.</p>

<p>"The young cub! I'd like to flog him!" thought
his uncle; but he did not consider it polite to give
utterance to this thought. "What a gentlemanly
appearance Ben has!" he said, instead.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Oakley, more graciously; for her
pride in Ben was her great, and perhaps it might be
said, her only weakness, cool and calculating woman
as she was. "I think he will do me credit, brother
Ephraim."</p>

<p>"Indeed he will. I am quite proud of him," said
Mr. Huxter, who thought he saw the best way to ingratiate
himself with his sister. "I can hardly believe
he's the same little Ben that used to run round
the farm barefooted. He don't like to think of those
old times, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Oakley; "he has a proud spirit,
Benjamin has."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all well enough as long as he has money
to support it. 'Poor and proud' don't go so well
together, sister Jane."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Oakley. "I was once
poor, but I never lost my pride. If I had I should
have given right up, and made no effort to better
myself."</p>

<p>"I know who you're thinking of. You're thinking
of me. You think I haven't got any proper pride.
Well, I don't know as I have. Misfortunes have
come thick and fast, and I've had a hard row to hoe.
Hard work and poverty are enough to take away a
man's pride."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter certainly did not look as if he could
ever have had much to be proud of; but then, pride
and merit do not always go together, and appearances
are sometimes deceitful.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Oakley, now graciously, "perhaps
matters may take a turn with you. I cannot do
much, for I have Mr. Oakley's son to provide for, as
well as Benjamin and myself; but I may be able to
do something."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane," said Mr. Huxter, more cheerfully.
"I was sure you would not harden your heart
against your only brother, and leave his family to
suffer, while you were living on the fat of the land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will talk further this evening, Ephraim,"
said Mrs. Oakley. "Excuse me for five minutes,
while I go out to the kitchen to see if supper is
nearly ready."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Jane. I don't mind confessing that
I feel rather hungry myself. I didn't take any dinner
at the Half-way House, to-day, for dinner costs
money, and with my narrow means I didn't feel as if
I could spare half a dollar."</p>

<p>"I am glad you mentioned it. I will see that
some cold meat be placed on the table. You must
require something hearty."</p>

<p>"It's my praising Ben that fetched her," said Mr.
Huxter, when, being left to himself, he began to reflect
upon the cause of his sister's sudden and agreeable
change of manners. "I shall have to flatter up the
young rascal, I expect, though I'd a good deal rather
give him a taste of a horsewhip. So he turns up his
nose at me, does he? He forgets the time when he'd
have been obliged to beg from house to house but
for me. Maybe he won't always be prosperous.
The race isn't always to the strong, nor the battle to
the swift."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter did not often read the Bible, and was
not aware that he had made a trifling mistake in his
quotation. His thoughts were turned into a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and more agreeable channel by the reappearance of
his sister, and the announcement that supper was
ready. He rose with alacrity, and followed Mrs.
Oakley into a room in the rear of the parlor, where
an abundant and appetizing meal was spread. Mr.
Huxter rubbed his hands with satisfaction,&mdash;for in
his own household the meals were neither abundant
nor inviting,&mdash;and took his seat at his sister's table.
Ben took the head of the table opposite his mother,
and John Oakley sat opposite Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"Who is this young man?" asked Mr. Huxter,
glancing at John. "I have not had the pleasure of
an introduction."</p>

<p>"That is John Oakley," said his stepmother,
briefly.</p>

<p>"The son of your lamented husband," said Mr.
Huxter.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you have milk and sugar in your
tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. I hope you are well, Mr. Oakley."</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you, sir," said John, wondering
who was addressing him.</p>

<p>"I am your stepmother's brother," continued Mr.
Huxter, "and that makes me a sort of relation, you
know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you help yourself to the toast, Ephraim?"
said Mrs. Oakley, in a quick, sharp tone, for she
didn't fancy the idea of her brother's paying so much
attention to John.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane. If it is as nice as your tea, I
shall want to help myself more than once. But you
were always a good house-keeper."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley did not relish this allusion, for she
would like to have had everybody forget that she had
been a professional house-keeper. She thought her
brother was succeeding admirably in making himself
disagreeable, and determined that he should not long
remain her guest, if she could conveniently get rid of
him. But Mr. Huxter had not penetration enough
to see that he was displeasing his sister, and continued,
his mouth being full of toast:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Oakley must be near your Benjamin's age,
Jane."</p>

<p>"I'm almost two years older," said Ben, who had
so few points of superiority that he might well claim
this.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I shouldn't have thought it," said his
uncle; "but then Mr. Oakley is very well grown for
his age."</p>

<p>"I don't know that Ben is deficient in that way,"
said Mrs. Oakley, coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not; I didn't mean to hint such a
thing. The boys must be a good deal of company
for each other."</p>

<p>"You're mistaken there," said Ben, shortly.</p>

<p>"They are not much together," said Mrs. Oakley.
"John goes to school, but Benjamin has finished his
education."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Huxter; "pray what studies
do you pursue, Mr. Oakley?"</p>

<p>"I am studying Latin, Greek, and mathematics,"
answered John.</p>

<p>"I want to know! Why, you are quite a scholar!
Are you going to college?" asked Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"That was what my father intended," said John.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oakley's death has interrupted all our plans,"
said Mrs. Oakley, coldly, "and we have not had time
to form new ones."</p>

<p>"What are your plans for Benjamin?" asked his
uncle. "Do you understand Latin and Greek, too,
Ben?"</p>

<p>"No; and I don't want to," said Ben. "It's all
nonsense, and won't do any good."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say as I care much about either
myself," said Mr. Huxter; "only it is fashionable to
study them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care whether it is fashionable or not,"
said Ben; "I shan't waste my time over them."</p>

<p>"Will you have some more toast, Ephraim?"
asked Mrs. Oakley, heartily tired of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I believe I will."</p>

<p>John mentally decided that Mr. Huxter was a singular
man, but did not dream that he was likely to
have considerable to do with him, and that ere long.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">HOW THE MATTER WAS SETTLED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> supper Mrs. Oakley and her brother were
left together. Ben had no particular fancy for the
society of his uncle, and John had no desire to intrude
upon Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Well, Ephraim," said Mrs. Oakley, plunging
into business at once, "I have been considering what
I could do for you."</p>

<p>"I knew you had a good heart, sister Jane," said
Mr. Huxter, who was disposed to be very complimentary
to his sister, now that his interest lay in
flattering her. Mrs. Oakley well remembered the
time when he treated her in quite a different manner;
but though she saw through his change of manner,
and thoroughly understood what prompted it, she
was well pleased to have it so. It made her feel the
power which her wealth had brought her; and there
was no woman who enjoyed that better than Mrs.
Oakley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mustn't expect too much," she continued.
"You must remember that there are others who have
claims upon me."</p>

<p>"But your means are large," said Mr. Huxter, who
was resolved to extort as much as possible.</p>

<p>"No doubt you think so; but I am the best judge
of what I can afford," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"If I were rich I wouldn't see you and Ben suffer,"
said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"As to that, your health is good, and your family
ought not to suffer if I gave you no assistance at all.
I don't think much of a man who can't support his
family."</p>

<p>"I've been a very unlucky man," said Mr. Huxter.
"I'd ought to be independent now, but something or
nuther was always happening. There was my best
cow, that I could have got fifty dollars for easy, up
and died one night."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"Three years," said Mr. Huxter, rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>"It seems to me you've had time to get over that
loss," said his sister, not betraying much sympathy
in her tone.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be much to you, I know; but to a
poor man like me it was a great loss," said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we won't say anything about that. I told
you that I would help you, and I will. You observed
John Oakley at the table?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he looks like a smart fellow."</p>

<p>"He's no smarter than Ben that I know of," said
Mrs. Oakley, jealously.</p>

<p>"Of course not; I didn't suppose he was," said Mr.
Huxter, seeing that he had got on the wrong tack.
"Ben is a boy that you may be proud of, sister Jane.
He is very genteel in his manners."</p>

<p>"I mean to bring him up as a gentleman," said
Mrs. Oakley. "I think I shall make a lawyer of
him."</p>

<p>"I hope you will. There's never been a lawyer in
our family. I should be proud to speak of my
nephew, Benjamin Brayton, Esq., the famous lawyer."</p>

<p>"I hope that time will come, brother Ephraim.
But I was going to speak of John Oakley. Ben and
he don't agree very well."</p>

<p>"Don't they?" asked Mr. Huxter, not so much
surprised as he might have been if he had not made
Ben's acquaintance. "I suppose it is John's fault."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. He doesn't treat Ben or myself
with proper respect, and of course Ben resents it."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to realize that Ben is older than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
himself, and therefore entitled to more privileges.
He went so far one day as to strike Ben with a whip."</p>

<p>"What did Ben do?" asked Mr. Huxter, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course he struck John," said Mrs. Oakley,
not thinking it necessary to mention that Ben's
blow came first.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Huxter, "it seems natural for
boys to quarrel."</p>

<p>"I shan't allow my son to be struck by John Oakley,"
said Mrs. Oakley, quickly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"That is what I am coming to. I think of sending
John away somewhere, so that we may live in
peace and quiet, and not be disturbed by his quarrelsome
disposition."</p>

<p>"Where do you think of sending him?"</p>

<p>"To your house."</p>

<p>"To my house?" exclaimed Mr. Huxter, in surprise,
for he had not foreseen what was coming.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know as he would like the way we live,"
said Mr. Huxter, thinking of the "picked-up"
dinners to which he was accustomed. "He's a rich
man's son, and has been used to good living."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself about that," said Mrs.
Oakley; "if he has always lived well, he can stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a little poor living now, by way of variety. It is his
own fault that I send him away from home."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter hardly knew what to think of this
arrangement. He had hoped that his sister would
settle an annual sum upon him, without any equivalent,
or would give him, say a thousand dollars outright.
Now she only proposed that he should take
a boarder.</p>

<p>"I don't know what my wife will say," he remarked.
"It will increase her work."</p>

<p>"Not much. There will only be one extra seat at
the table."</p>

<p>"But we shall have to put ourselves out a little
for him."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to put yourself out at all," said
Mrs. Oakley, emphatically.</p>

<p>"He's a rich man's son."</p>

<p>"But he'll be a poor man himself. He will have
to earn his living by hard work."</p>

<p>"I don't see how that can be. Didn't his father
leave plenty of money?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Oakley, determined not to be
entrapped into any such acknowledgment; "and if
he had, John is no better off for it. You seem to
forget that all the money is left to me."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," said Mr. Huxter. "I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
think of that. Shan't you leave any of it to
John?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon his behavior," said Mrs.
Oakley. "I make no promises. The property is all
mine, and I shall leave it to no one who treats me
with disrespect. You see, therefore, that you need
feel on no ceremony with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter did see it. He was a selfish man, who
had a great respect for the possessors of wealth
merely on the score of their wealth, and he began to
look upon John Oakley with quite different eyes now
that he had been informed of his true position.</p>

<p>"You're carrying things with rather a high hand,
Jane," he said.</p>

<p>"I mean to be treated with respect."</p>

<p>"So John is saucy, is he?"</p>

<p>"He is proud-spirited, and thinks himself justified
in looking down upon me, because I was once his
father's house-keeper," said Mrs. Oakley, in a tone of
bitterness; "but I have vowed to subdue his proud
spirit, and you will see that I shall do it."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you will, Jane. But there is
one thing you haven't mentioned."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"How much am I to receive for John Oakley's
board?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will give you six dollars a week, and you know
that this is considerably more than any other boarder
would pay you."</p>

<p>"Six dollars a week!" said Mr. Huxter, slowly.
"Yes, I suppose that would pay for what he would
eat and drink, but I expected you would do something
more for me than just to find me a boarder."</p>

<p>"You will make a pretty good profit out of that,
Ephraim."</p>

<p>"You might do a little more than that for me,
Jane."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I will do. Besides paying
you regularly for his board, I will allow you his
labor, and that will be worth considerable."</p>

<p>"What can he do?"</p>

<p>"He can do what other boys do. You can take
him into your shop, and set him to pegging shoes.
It won't hurt him a bit, though it may trouble his
pride a little."</p>

<p>"But will he be willing to go into the shop? He
was expecting to go to college."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of you if you can't compel
him to do it."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter reflected a moment. John's work
would be worth at least five dollars a week, and this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
added to the six he would receive from his sister,
would certainly pay munificently for John's board.</p>

<p>"Well, that is a consideration. We'll call it a
bargain," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Very well; I think you'll find your account in
it," said Mrs. Oakley, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you pay me a quarter's board in
advance?"</p>

<p>To this Mrs. Oakley assented with some hesitation.</p>

<p>After matters had thus been satisfactorily arranged,
Mr. Huxter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think, Jane, I will just take a little walk outside,
and smoke a pipe. I always do after supper.
By the way, when would you like to have young
Oakley go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" repeated Mr. Huxter, in some disappointment,
for he had confidently hoped to avail
himself of his sister's hospitality for a week at least.
"Seems to me, Jane, you're in something of a
hurry."</p>

<p>"I am. There is a good reason for it, which I am
not at liberty to mention," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Not even to me?"</p>

<p>"Not even to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I dare say it is all right, but I am tired
after my journey, and it don't give me much time to
rest," said Mr. Huxter, with disappointment.</p>

<p>"Let it be day after to-morrow, then. I don't
want to be inhospitable," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter thought this concession better than
nothing, and, going out on the door-step, smoked
his pipe in rather a cheerful frame of mind.</p>

<p>"It'll be a pretty good speculation," he reflected;
"but I mistrust I'll have some trouble with young
Oakley. But I guess I can manage him. He'll find
me pretty ugly if he goes to oppose me."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was partly right. He was capable of
being "pretty ugly" when he thought it safe to be
so,&mdash;that is, to those who were weaker than himself,
and in his power. He fawned upon those who had
money or power, and was in the habit of tyrannizing
over those who had neither. On the whole, I hardly
think John is to be congratulated upon his prospects.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN CONSULTS A LAWYER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Oakley</span> felt very well pleased with the arrangement
she had made about John. Her brother lived
nearly one hundred miles distant. She would have
liked John even further off; but this would remove
him from the ability to interfere with her plans.
She felt, too, that she would be more comfortable with
him out of the house. Until the will was found <i>and
destroyed</i> she would not feel safe, and she did not venture
to search thoroughly till John was out of the way.</p>

<p>But there was one important question: Would John
consent to go? On this point Mrs. Oakley felt doubtful.
She knew that it would be a grievous disappointment
to him to leave his class at the academy,
and all his young friends in the village, not to speak
of his natural regret at leaving the house where he
had been born, and which had always been his home.
Under the circumstances, therefore, she felt that it
would be best to use a little stratagem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile John had been thinking earnestly of
his position and his duty. He felt that he needed
advice, and he determined to call upon Squire
Selwyn, who, as I have already said, was his
father's legal adviser and intimate friend. His son
Sam, also, was John's best friend, and thus the
families had a double bond of union.</p>

<p>The day succeeding Mr. Huxter's arrival was
Wednesday. On that day the afternoon session at
the academy was over an hour earlier than usual, the
only exercise being declamation, or, on alternate
weeks, the reading of compositions. John thought
this would be the most favorable opportunity he
would have for consulting Mr. Selwyn.</p>

<p>Squire Selwyn's office was a small, neat one-story
building situated on the main street, not far from the
academy building. It was painted white, with green
blinds, and had been built expressly for a law
office.</p>

<p>Sam and John walked home from school together
as usual. When they came to the office John
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going in to see your father, Sam; so I'll bid
you good-afternoon."</p>

<p>"Got some law business for the governor?"</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you better consult me," said Sam. "I
swept out the office for a week once when the office-boy
was off on vacation, and you can't think what a
lot of law I picked up in that time."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said John, smiling. "I don't
doubt your qualifications, but I think I'll consult
your father this time."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sam, more seriously. "I'm
glad you're going to. The fact is, Mrs. Oakley is
doing her best to circumvent you, and you must do
your best, or she'll succeed."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she will at any rate," said John.</p>

<p>"I wish you could find that will."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Do you believe in dreams, John?" asked Sam,
lowering his voice.</p>

<p>"What makes you ask that?"</p>

<p>"Because I dreamed last night that I found the
will. It seemed to me that it was very dark, and I
came upon Mrs. Oakley and Ben, each with a lantern
in their hand, searching about on the ground for it.
I followed them softly, and all at once spied a white
paper. Mrs. Oakley saw it at the same time, and
reached out for it, but I was too quick, and carried
it off in triumph."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not quite. When she and Ben saw that I had
got it they dropped their lanterns and ran after me,
or rather Ben threw his at my head. It was an
awful whack. Just then I woke up, and found that
I had struck my head against the bedpost."</p>

<p>"Well," said John, laughing, "how do you interpret
that dream?"</p>

<p>"In this way. I think that the will is going to be
found some day, and that I shall be the one to find
it."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope you will. It would make a
great change in my circumstances."</p>

<p>"What'll you give me if I find it, John?"</p>

<p>"A gold watch," said John.</p>

<p>"Well, that's worth working for."</p>

<p>"You seem to be in earnest about it."</p>

<p>"There's many a true word spoken in jest. The
time may come when I shall remind you of your
promise."</p>

<p>"I hope it will. You will find that I keep my
promises."</p>

<p>"All right. Well, there's the squire looking out
the window, so I'll leave you. Good luck!"</p>

<p>John entered the office.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, John," said Squire Selwyn.
"How are things going on at home?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are all well," said John.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>The lawyer was a man of middle height. He had
a pleasant face and manner, but his eye was keen
and penetrating, and seemed to be reading the person
upon whom it rested. He was deservedly popular,
for it was always his endeavor to conciliate
rather than to foment quarrels, and he more than
once succeeded in dissuading a client from a lawsuit
which would have put a considerable sum of money
into his own pocket. He was a safe legal adviser,
and an honest lawyer. He was glad to see John, for
he had always been attracted towards him, not only
because of his friendship for the father, but because
of John's truthfulness and straightforwardness.</p>

<p>Seeing that John hesitated, he said, by way of
encouragement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If there is anything I can do for you, don't
hesitate to ask it. Your father was my friend, and I
hope to be regarded by his son in the same light."</p>

<p>"It is because of that that I have called upon
you, Squire Selwyn," said John. "You know, of
course," he added, after a little hesitation, "how my
father left his property?"</p>

<p>"I know how he <i>appears</i> to have left it," said the
lawyer, significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would like to ask you a question, Squire
Selwyn," said John; "but of course you will not
answer it unless you think proper."</p>

<p>"Very properly put. Ask your question, and I
will decide as to its fitness."</p>

<p>"It is this: Do you know whether my father
made any later will than the one which was
found?"</p>

<p>"I have no hesitation in answering your question.
He did."</p>

<p>"How long since was it made?"</p>

<p>"Only three months before he died."</p>

<p>"I suppose that it disposed of the property
differently?"</p>

<p>"It disposed of it as the law would have done if
no will had been made. Your stepmother was to
have her thirds; the rest of the property would
have gone to you. The matter might have been
left to the law but for the existence of the former
will, which was in Mrs. Oakley's charge, and which
she said that she had mislaid."</p>

<p>"Who would have been my guardian under the
last will, Squire Selwyn?"</p>

<p>"Your father asked me to assume that office, and
I consented cheerfully, not only from my friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for him, but because I have a very good opinion of
you," said Squire Selwyn.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said John, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Let me add, my young friend," said the lawyer,
kindly, "that I hope you will come to me as freely
for advice as if I really filled this office."</p>

<p>"I will, sir," said John. "I am so situated that
I need a friend to advise me who is older and wiser
than myself."</p>

<p>"Apply to me freely at all times," said the lawyer,
pleased with John's modest demeanor.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I want to tell you," said
John; "I think my father's last will is still in existence."</p>

<p>"What grounds have you for such a belief?" asked
Squire Selwyn, regarding him closely.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, sir," said John.</p>

<p>He then related the particulars of his last interview
with his father, and the great effort which the sick
man made to communicate something to him.</p>

<p>Squire Selwyn listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Will you repeat the words which you could distinguish?"
he said.</p>

<p>"I distinctly heard father say, 'my will,' and I
thought I heard him say also 'drawer.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you told me this," said the lawyer,
thoughtfully. "Did he attempt to say more?"</p>

<p>"There was no chance. Mrs. Oakley entered the
chamber, and ordered me out. She said I was disturbing
father."</p>

<p>"Do you think she heard the words which your
father uttered?"</p>

<p>"I know she could not, for it was only by placing
my ear close to his mouth that I could distinguish
the little I did."</p>

<p>"How did your father seem affected by the interruption?"</p>

<p>"He seemed disappointed."</p>

<p>"Didn't you have any further chance to speak with
your father?"</p>

<p>"No; Mrs. Oakley would never admit me
again."</p>

<p>The lawyer sat for a moment plunged in thought.
At length he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you ever chanced, since your father's death,
to see your stepmother searching the papers he left
behind?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell me when."</p>

<p>John related the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Did she give any explanation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said she was looking for a receipt."</p>

<p>"Didn't she seem disturbed at your seeing her thus
engaged?"</p>

<p>"She seemed angry, and accused me of prying
into her actions."</p>

<p>"What opinion did you form of her object at that
time?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I thought she was looking for the will," said
John, frankly.</p>

<p>"Are your relations with your stepmother pleasant?"
asked Squire Selwyn.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say they are not," said John. "If
they had been, I would not have troubled myself
about the will. But I can see that Mrs. Oakley is
determined to persecute me, and make my life unhappy,
and that she is determined not to carry out
any of my father's plans about my education. She
has already taken away my horse, and sold it. She
intended to give it to Ben, but he had an unlucky
adventure with it one afternoon."</p>

<p>"I heard of that," said the lawyer, smiling. "He
got thrown, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That cured him of wanting to ride, and
so the horse was sold."</p>

<p>"It was a present to you from your father, was it
not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Ben received at the same time a gold
watch, which he still has."</p>

<p>"That seems hardly fair. One question more:
Have you any knowledge of any secret drawer in
your father's desk, or in any article which he used to
own?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. If there had been one, he would
hardly have disclosed its whereabouts to a boy.
Well, my young friend," said the lawyer, rising, as if
to terminate the interview, "I am glad to have received
this call from you. I regard your information as
important. It strengthens the conviction which I
before entertained, that <i>your father's last will is in
existence somewhere</i>. Out of regard to your interests,
as well as to carry out his last wishes, I sincerely
hope that it may be found. But I need not tell you
that in the present position of affairs the greatest
caution is absolutely necessary. I am not prepared
to advise you at present, but shall take your case
under my most serious consideration."</p>

<p>John took his cap and books, and Squire Selwyn
accompanied him to the door of the office. As
they stood on the threshold, an open wagon drove
by. Both looked up simultaneously, and an expression
of vexation swept over the lawyer's face as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
recognized Mrs. Oakley and her brother. Mrs. Oakley's
eye lighted up as it rested upon John.</p>

<p>"He is getting dangerous," she thought. "It is
well I am going to be rid of him."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John</span> could not help wondering what inference
Mrs. Oakley would draw from seeing him in consultation
with the lawyer. He anticipated that it would
arouse her suspicions, and lead to his being treated
with greater coldness and harshness than ever. It
was with considerable surprise, therefore, that on
presenting himself at the supper-table he received a
very pleasant greeting from his stepmother. She
made no allusion to having met him, but, in her conversation
with her brother, asked two or three questions
of John, in an easy way, as if the relations between
them were perfectly cordial. Ben glanced at
his mother once or twice in surprise, for she had not
seen fit to take him into her confidence, and he did
not understand what this sudden cordiality meant.
John, who had usually been excluded from any share
in the conversation, was not only surprised, but
pleased, and hoped that the change would be permanent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
His resentment was not lasting, and he was
prepared to respond to his stepmother's advances.
Mr. Huxter's conduct puzzled him a little. That
gentleman seemed disposed to be quite affable and
social.</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Oakley, you and Benjamin will some
time favor me with a visit at my humble home. I
cannot promise you as good accommodations as you
have at home, but I shall be very glad to see you&mdash;very."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said John.</p>

<p>Ben, who was not remarkable for politeness, did
not deign a word in reply to his uncle's invitation.</p>

<p>In spite of Mr. Huxter's not very prepossessing
exterior John began to think him quite a pleasant
man, and felt obliged to him for his invitation, though
he felt no particular desire to accept it.</p>

<p>After supper was over, Mr. Huxter turned to
John:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going out on the door-step to smoke my
pipe. I suppose you don't smoke?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said John.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you to join me; but of course
you don't smoke. It isn't good for boys. Do you
smoke, Ben?"</p>

<p>"I don't smoke a <i>pipe</i>," said Ben, glancing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
some disgust at the clay pipe, the bowl of which his
uncle was filling.</p>

<p>"I suppose you, being a young gentleman, smoke
cigars. They are more aristocratic. But I'm a poor
man, and I can't afford them. Well, if you'll get
your cigar, we'll have a social smoke together."</p>

<p>"I've got an engagement," said Ben, not very
graciously, and, putting on his hat, he stalked off.</p>

<p>"He's an impudent puppy," said Mr. Huxter to
himself. "I wish I had the training of him for a
little while. But I must put up with his insults, or
lose all hope of help from my sister."</p>

<p>"Come home early, Benjamin," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't sit up for me. You go to bed so
precious early it doesn't give me any evening at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley followed him with her eyes a little uneasily.
While Mr. Oakley was alive Ben kept pretty
straight, for he stood somewhat in awe of his stepfather;
but since his death he had shown a disposition
to have his own way, and his mother's wishes
weighed very little with him. She could not help
feeling that the boy in whom her dearest hopes centred,
and for whom she was willing even to wrong
another, manifested very little gratitude for her devotion
to him. John, whom she charged with lack
of respect, treated her at all times much more respectfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
than her own son. But Mrs. Oakley was
prejudiced, and would not see this. She shut her
eyes alike to John's merits and Ben's faults, and the
latter took his own way, spending the evening in the
bar-room and billiard saloon, and learning much that
he ought not to have learned.</p>

<p>About half-past nine in the evening, when John
was studying his lesson in "Xenophon's Anabasis," he
heard a low knock at the door. Supposing it to be
one of the servants, he said, carelessly, "Come in!"</p>

<p>Looking up, as the door opened, he was not a little
surprised at the entrance of his stepmother. With
the instincts of a young gentleman, he rose hastily,
and, drawing a chair, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mrs. Oakley?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, John," said his stepmother; "I will
sit down a moment. You are studying, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was preparing my Greek lesson for to-morrow."</p>

<p>John tried not to look surprised, but he wondered
very much what should have led to a call from Mrs.
Oakley, especially at so late an hour.</p>

<p>"You are getting on well in your studies, I have
no doubt."</p>

<p>"Thank you. So my teacher says."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. I am afraid it will be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
interruption for you to be absent from school a few
days."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be an interruption; but if you wish
it, I could try to make it up afterwards."</p>

<p>"I came to ask a favor of that kind."</p>

<p>"Does she want me to work on the farm?" thought
John, puzzled.</p>

<p>But he was not long kept in doubt.</p>

<p>"My brother, who is now stopping here, leaves for
home to-morrow morning," proceeded Mrs. Oakley.
"There's a little business I want attended to, which
makes it desirable that some one should go back with
him. I might send Ben, but I don't think he would
answer the purpose. So I have thought of you."</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Huxter go to-morrow morning?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"He has just decided to do so. That, I am aware,
gives you but short notice," said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Shall I need to be away long?"</p>

<p>"A few days at least. Have you a carpet-bag?"</p>

<p>"A small one."</p>

<p>"That will answer. You can put in a couple of
shirts, some collars, stockings, and handkerchiefs."</p>

<p>"How shall I know what to do?"</p>

<p>"My brother will give you all the needful information.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
And now, good-night. We shall breakfast at
six, in order to be in time for the stage."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will be ready."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley left the room, and went downstairs,
leaving John considerably puzzled by what had
happened. He was sorry to be kept from school for
a few days even, for he was at the head of his class
both in Greek and Latin, and would lose his standing
temporarily at least. But it was characteristic of
him to be obliging, even at the cost of some self-sacrifice,
and therefore he had made no opposition to the
wishes of his stepmother, though it did occur to him
that, as Ben neither attended school nor did anything
else except amuse himself, he might have executed
his mother's commission. However, John knew
enough of Ben's disobliging disposition to suspect
that he had been applied to and refused, especially
as he could see that he had no great affection for his
uncle. Of course he could have no suspicion of the
trap which Mrs. Oakley had artfully laid for him, and
that the few days' absence were intended by her to
extend to months and possibly years.</p>

<p>"If I am going early to-morrow morning," thought
John, "I may as well stop studying and pack my
carpet-bag. I wish I had asked Mrs. Oakley where
her brother lives."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>John closed his "Anabasis," and found his carpet-bag.
Into it he put whatever he thought would be
needed in a week's absence. He did not suppose he
should be away longer than that.</p>

<p>"If it were not so late," he thought, "I would run
over and tell Sam that I am to be away for a few
days. He will be surprised when he don't see me at
school."</p>

<p>But it was too late, for the village clock just then
struck ten, and as he must be up early, John felt
that the best thing he could do was to go to bed and
get a good night's sleep, to prepare him for the
fatigues of the succeeding day.</p>

<p>After a sound and refreshing night's sleep, John
went downstairs the next morning, with his carpet-bag
in his hand. The table was spread for breakfast,
and Mr. Huxter and Mrs. Oakley had already
taken their seats.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, John," said Mrs. Oakley; "you
are just in time. Are you all ready to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John.</p>

<p>"Then sit down to breakfast, for the stage will be
here very soon."</p>

<p>"So I am to have the pleasure of your company,
Mr. Oakley?" said Mr. Huxter. "I did not anticipate
that I should so soon receive a visit from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you when I invited you yesterday to my humble
home."</p>

<p>"In what town do you live, Mr. Huxter?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"Well, folks call it Hardscrabble," said Mr. Huxter,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Is it far away?"</p>

<p>"We'll get there to-night if nothing happens,"
said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>John did not know whether to conclude that Hardscrabble
was, or was not, the real name of the town,
but did not like to press the inquiry. He never
remembered to have heard of a town bearing that
name. However, he would know by evening at any
rate. He could not help feeling some curiosity as to
Mr. Huxter's home; but neither that gentleman's
appearance nor description of it led him to form a
very high idea of its sumptuousness.</p>

<p>The breakfast was a substantial one, and Mr.
Huxter did justice to it. Indeed, he was seldom
wanting in a good appetite, especially when the repast
was an inviting one.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shan't see Ben before I go?" said
he, leaning back in his chair, and picking his teeth
with a fork.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," said Mrs. Oakley. "Ben got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
home rather late last night, and I suppose the poor
boy is tired this morning. I think I had better not
disturb him."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb him on my account," said his
uncle, who did not seem much disappointed by Ben's
absence. "He'd better have his sleep out. But,
sister Jane, if I were you I wouldn't let him stay out
so late in the evening."</p>

<p>"You must remember, Ephraim, he's a young
gentleman now. It won't do to keep him in leading-strings,
just as if he were a boy."</p>

<p>"I'd keep him in check if he were my boy,"
thought Mr. Huxter; but he saw that it would not
be best to say so.</p>

<p>"Well, Jane, of course you know best," he said.
"When are you coming to make us a visit?"</p>

<p>"Not very soon, I am afraid. I can't leave the
farm very well. There are too many things which
need attending to."</p>

<p>"There's the stage," said John, suddenly.</p>

<p>The rumbling of the wheels was faintly heard up
the road. All rose from the table, and prepared to
go. Mrs. Oakley brought out a covered basket and
handed it to her brother.</p>

<p>"I've put some sandwiches in this basket," she
said. "You'll be hungry by and by, and it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
save you the expense of stopping at a hotel for dinner."</p>

<p>"Very good!" said Mr. Huxter, with satisfaction.
"That's what I meant to speak about, but I forgot
it. I begrudge paying for dinner at a tavern. They
always charge you about double what it's worth.
Come, Mr. Oakley, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready, sir."</p>

<p>The rumbling of the stage was now distinctly
heard. They opened the front door, and made
signals for it to stop. The lumbering vehicle was
brought to in front of the gate, and the driver jumped
from his elevated perch, and opened the door for the
passengers to enter.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a seat outside, if it makes no
difference to you, Mr. Huxter," said John.</p>

<p>"Just as you like," was the reply.</p>

<p>So, while Mr. Huxter got inside, John took a
seat beside the driver.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, John?" asked the driver,
who knew everybody in the village, and was on intimate
terms with all.</p>

<p>"I'm going away with the gentleman who has just
got inside," said John.</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the name of the place," said our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hero, suspecting that Hardscrabble was only a local
appellation.</p>

<p>"Be gone long?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a week."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Oakley watched the receding
stage with satisfaction. When it was out of sight,
she entered the house.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, "I'll look for the will without
John Oakley to spy upon me."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN OAKLEY'S NEW HOME.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> John would prefer to have remained at
home, in order that his studies might be uninterrupted,
he nevertheless could not help deriving
enjoyment from the ride on the stage-coach. It was
a beautiful morning. The sun was gilding with its
beams the fields and brooks, and a beautiful breeze
rustled in and out among the leaves of the trees that
for some distance lined the road. John, from his
elevated perch, had an excellent view of the scenes
through which they passed. As they rode by the
house of Squire Selwyn, lie hoped to catch sight of
his friend Sam; but Sam was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Sam is lazy this morning," thought John, disappointed.</p>

<p>But there he did Sam injustice. He had risen
early, and with hook and line had gone to the pond
to fish. From a distance he caught a glimpse of the
stage rumbling along the village street, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
too far off for him to distinguish the outside passengers.
He would have been surprised had he known
that among them was his friend John.</p>

<p>Ere long they were beyond the limits of the township.
Occasionally the stage stopped to take in a
fresh passenger, or to discharge a portion of its living
freight. At intervals of a few miles they came to
some village tavern, with a broad swinging sign,
where the driver would pause to water his horses, or,
at longer intervals, to exchange them for a fresh
supply. Once or twice John descended to stretch
his legs, stiff with long sitting. More than once he
observed Mr. Huxter enter the tavern, and come out
with his nose a little redder than usual.</p>

<p>"I went in to get a glass of bitters," he explained
to John, whom he encountered at the door on one of
these occasions. "I'll get you some if you want it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John. "I don't care for any."</p>

<p>"Well, you're young and strong, and don't need
them. When you get to my age, you'll need a little
something to stimulate you."</p>

<p>John, who rightly conjectured that the glass of
"bitters" was only another name for New England
rum, could not help thinking that Mr. Huxter would
have been quite as well off without it; but this
thought he of course kept to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old gentleman is rather fond of 'wetting his
whistle,' isn't he?" said the driver, familiarly.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said John, briefly.</p>

<p>He did not care to discuss the conduct of his stepmother's
brother with any one, and therefore confined
himself to this remark. At twelve o'clock they had
travelled forty miles.</p>

<p>"The stage will stop half an hour for dinner," said
the driver, as he drew up in front of an old-fashioned
country tavern.</p>

<p>"This is as far as I go," said the driver to John.
"Do you stop here?"</p>

<p>"No, we go further on."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be comin' back this way in a few
days?"</p>

<p>"I expect so. By the way, if you see Sam Selwyn
to-night, just tell him that I was one of your
passengers this morning."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"John Oakley!" said Mr. Huxter, from below.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said John.</p>

<p>"Just get down, and bring that basket with you.
We'll go under the trees and have a bite."</p>

<p>John followed directions, and the two sat down
together, with the basket between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Travelling is hungry work," said Mr. Huxter.
"Let's see what my sister has put up for us."</p>

<p>The basket, being uncovered, proved to be full of
sandwiches, with a few doughnuts on top. They
were all excellent of their kind; for Mrs. Oakley,
whatever might be said of her in other respects, was
a good house-keeper, and took care that whatever
food was prepared in the house should be good.</p>

<p>"Now, Oakley," said Mr. Huxter, "we needn't
have any ceremony here. Just make yourself at
home and pitch in."</p>

<p>It may be observed that Mr. Huxter was gradually
beginning to treat John with greater familiarity.
When first introduced, he had addressed him as "Mr.
Oakley." Next it was "John Oakley." Now it was
"Oakley," without any prefix. John, who had no
inordinate sense of his own dignity, was not much
disturbed by this, but continued to treat Mr. Huxter
with the same outward respect as at first.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter followed his own recommendations
strictly. He did "pitch in," and with such vigor
that he consumed two-thirds of the contents of the
basket, while John, whose appetite had also been
stimulated by the long ride, was eating the remaining
third.</p>

<p>"Well, there aint much left, that's a fact," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
surveying the empty basket. "The ride's given you
a pretty good appetite, Oakley."</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said John, smiling at the unexpected
inference drawn from the empty basket.</p>

<p>"That's lucky, for we shan't get anything more till
we get home," said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"When will that be?" inquired John.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about seven. It's a long pull; but I
guess we can stand it," said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"I think I can," said John.</p>

<p>"The old lady won't be expecting us," said Mr.
Huxter. "I told her I might, maybe, be gone a fortnight."</p>

<p>"She'll be glad to see you so soon," said John,
who did not think of anything else to say.</p>

<p>"Umph!" said Mr. Huxter, in a tone which might
be interpreted as conveying a little doubt on this
point. "I feel a little dry," he said, rising and
stretching himself. "I think I'll go into the house,
and see if I can find a little water."</p>

<p>When Mr. Huxter reappeared, John inferred from
his appearance that, if he had been drinking water,
it had been largely mingled with a different beverage.
He satisfied his own thirst at the pump, where he
drank a deep and refreshing draught of clear cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
water, purer and better than any liquid which the art
of man has devised.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed. Twice more Mr. Huxter
got out of the stage, and entered a wayside tavern, on
the same mysterious errand. Each time he reappeared
with his nose redder, and his eyes more inflamed.
The liquor which he had drunk made him
quarrelsome, and so disagreeable to his fellow-passengers.
Finally one of them called to the driver in
an authoritative voice to stop, and insisted that Mr.
Huxter should travel outside for the remainder of the
way. With some difficulty he was induced to make
the change, and from that time John had the pleasure
of his society.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Mr. Huxter, fixing his
eyes upon John with a vacant stare.</p>

<p>"I am John Oakley," said our hero.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know. You're the son of old Oakley
that my sister Jane married."</p>

<p>It was painful to John to hear his father spoken of
as old Oakley, but he understood Mr. Huxter's situation,
and felt that it would be idle to resent anything
said under such circumstances.</p>

<p>"Old Oakley left all his property to Jane," continued
Mr. Huxter, with a drunken laugh. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
she's a deep one, is Jane! She knows how her bread
is buttered."</p>

<p>John turned away in disgust, and tried not to heed
what was said.</p>

<p>"But she's hard on her poor brother," whined Mr.
Huxter. "She ought to have come down with something
handsome."</p>

<p>His mutterings became incoherent, and John ceased
to notice them. At length, about seven o'clock, the
stage drove into a small village, of not particularly
attractive appearance.</p>

<p>"Well," said the driver, turning to John, "you're
most home."</p>

<p>"Am I?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Of course you are. Aint you travelling with
<i>him</i>?" indicating Mr. Huxter by a gesture.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've come with him on a little business."</p>

<p>"Then you're not going to stay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Lucky for you!"</p>

<p>John didn't inquire why the driver thought it lucky
for him. He thought he understood without any
explanation.</p>

<p>"Do you go any further?" he asked of the driver.</p>

<p>"To the next town."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this place?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some folks call it Hardscrabble; but the real
name is Jackson."</p>

<p>"Where does Mr. Huxter live?"</p>

<p>"Up the road apiece. I go right by the gate. I'll
stop and leave you there."</p>

<p>A little less than a mile further the driver reined
up his horses.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said. "Now look sharp, for
I'm behind time."</p>

<p>With some difficulty Mr. Huxter, who had now become
quite drowsy, was made to understand that he
had reached home. With still greater difficulty, he
was assisted in safety to the ground, and the stage
drove on.</p>

<p>John now for the first time looked about him to see
what sort of a place he had reached. He distinguished
a two-story house, old-fashioned in appearance,
standing a few rods back from the road. It
was sadly in need of a fresh coat of paint, as was
also the fence which surrounded it. A little distance
from the house, at one side, was a small building of
one story, liberally supplied with windows, which
John afterwards learned to be a shoe-shop. It was
Mr. Huxter's place of business, when he saw fit to
work, which was by no means regularly. An old
cart, a wood-pile, and some barrels littered up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
front yard. A field alongside was overgrown with
weeds, and everything indicated shiftlessness and
neglect.</p>

<p>John had no difficulty in opening the front gate,
for it hung upon one hinge, and was never shut. He
supported Mr. Huxter to the door and knocked, for
there was no bell. The summons was answered by a
girl of ten, in a dirty calico dress and dishevelled
hair.</p>

<p>"Mother," she screamed, shrilly, as she saw who
it was, "here's father come home, and there's somebody
with him!"</p>

<p>At this intimation, a woman came from a back
room to the door. She looked thin and careworn, as
if the life which she led was not a very happy
one.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huxter, I suppose?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she.</p>

<p>"Your husband does not feel quite well," said
John, expressing in as delicate a manner as possible
the fact that something was out of order with Mr.
Huxter.</p>

<p>"Who said I wasn't well?" exclaimed Mr. Huxter,
in a rough voice. "Never was better in my life. I
say, Polly, can't you get us something to eat? I'm
most starved."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter looked inquiringly at John, whose
presence with her husband she did not understand.</p>

<p>"I believe I am to stop here for a day or two,"
said John, responding to her look. "My name is
John Oakley. I am the stepson of Mr. Huxter's sister."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," said Mrs. Huxter. "I am
afraid we can't accommodate you very well, Mr. Oakley,
but we'll do our best."</p>

<p>"What's good enough for us is good enough for
him," said Mr. Huxter, fiercely. "He's as poor as
we are. Sister Jane's got all the money. She's a
deep one, is sister Jane."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be offended at what he says,
Mr. Oakley," said Mrs. Huxter, in an apologetic tone.
"He don't mean what he says."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Mrs. Huxter!" said her husband, who
was disposed to be quarrelsome. "Don't make a fool
of yourself, but get supper as soon as you can."</p>

<p>"We haven't got any meat in the house," said Mrs.
Huxter, timidly. "You know you only left me a
little money."</p>

<p>"Here's some money," said Mr. Huxter, fumbling
in his pocket, and producing a five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter took the bill, surprised at its large
amount, for she seldom got more than one dollar at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
time. Forthwith the girl of ten was sent for some
steak at the butcher's, and in a reasonable time supper
was declared to be ready. Meanwhile Mr. Huxter
had been to the pump, and by the free use of cold
water, applied externally, succeeded in getting the
better of his intoxication, and was prepared to do
full justice to the meal provided.</p>

<p>By the time supper was over, it was half-past eight.
John felt fatigued with his long journey, and asked
permission to retire. He was shown to an attic
chamber, furnished only with a cot bed and a broken
chair. But, rude as were the accommodations, John
slept soundly, little dreaming the unwelcome news
that awaited him on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MR. HUXTER AT HOME.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> John awoke the next morning he found it difficult
at first to understand where he was; but recollection
soon came to his aid, and he remembered that he
was Mr. Huxter's guest. He rose from the cot-bed, and,
going to the window, looked out. The prospect was
not a very pleasant one. Just across the street was
a pasture, with here and there a gnarled and stunted
tree. The immediate neighborhood of Mr. Huxter's
house has already been described.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder they call it Hardscrabble,"
thought John. "I shouldn't like to live here."</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Huxter's head was thrust in
through the open door.</p>

<p>"Come, Oakley," said he, "it's time to get up.
We don't want any lazy folks here."</p>

<p>"I was tired with my ride yesterday, and overslept
myself," said John.</p>

<p>"Well, dress as quick as you can," said Mr. Huxter,
turning to descend the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see any washbowl," said John, hesitating.</p>

<p>"You can come downstairs and wash, like the rest
of us," said Mr. Huxter. "You needn't expect us to
lug up water for you."</p>

<p>John did not reply to this rude speech; but he
could not avoid being struck by the change in the
manner of his host. Mr. Huxter had, when first introduced,
treated him with elaborate politeness. Now
he treated him with downright rudeness, and as if
he possessed some authority over him. John did
not understand this, nor did he like it; but as it was
only for a few days at the farthest, he resolved not to
repay rudeness with rudeness, but to behave with as
much respect as circumstances would allow. In the
mean time he would ascertain as soon as possible the
object of his visit, and so hasten matters as to allow
of his return home with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>Dressing hastily, he went downstairs, and found the
breakfast-table spread in the kitchen. Mr. Huxter
was seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>"Down at last, Oakley," he said. "Sit right up."</p>

<p>"I should like to wash first," said John.</p>

<p>"Well, there's the sink, and there's a tin basin,"
said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mr. Oakley," said Mrs. Huxter,
"I'll wash out the basin for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's clean enough," said her husband.</p>

<p>"No, there's been some greasy water in it," said
Mrs. Huxter.</p>

<p>"You're mighty anxious to wait on him," sneered
Mr. Huxter. "You don't seem to think me of any
consequence."</p>

<p>His wife did not reply. Poor woman! she had a
hard time of it. She had always had to contend with
poverty; but poverty is not the worst of evils. If her
husband had been reasonably kind, she could have
borne that without repining, though it subjected her
to many privations which she well knew might have
been avoided had not her husband been so shiftless
and intemperate. But his temper was far from
sweet. He was that detestable character, a domestic
tyrant, and did all in his power to make his wife uncomfortable
and unhappy. She had learned that her best
course was to permit his taunts and harsh words to
pass unheeded, for at such times reason had no
weight with him.</p>

<p>It did not take John long to understand the position
of affairs. He saw that Mrs. Huxter was disposed
to be polite and kind to him, and he felt
grateful. He could not help pitying her for having
such a husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Huxter," he said, when she had
prepared the basin for him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are accustomed to washing in your
own room," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said John; "but it's of no consequence. I
can wash down here just as well."</p>

<p>"Of course you can," said Mr. Huxter. "Come,
be spry there, Oakley."</p>

<p>John washed himself deliberately, not thinking that
it was necessary to hurry himself on Mr. Huxter's
account, and sat down to the table.</p>

<p>"You're an enterprising young man," said Mr.
Huxter. "I'm half through my breakfast, and you're
just ready to begin."</p>

<p>"He had a long and tiresome journey yesterday,"
said Mrs. Huxter. "No wonder he was tired."</p>

<p>"So had I," said her husband. "You don't seem
to think I can ever get tired, even when I've been
working like a dog."</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Most seven."</p>

<p>"Seven is our breakfast-hour at home," said John,
quietly. "As you did not tell me you breakfasted
earlier here, you could not expect me to get up sooner
than I did."</p>

<p>"That's true, Mr. Oakley," said Mrs. Huxter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you're siding with him,&mdash;are you?" said Mr.
Huxter, angrily.</p>

<p>John was far from being a coward. He was disposed
to treat every one with courtesy and respect,
but expected to be treated in the same way. Mr.
Huxter's manner was so very offensive, and his
words so dictatorial, that his anger was excited. He
felt that he could not with proper self-respect remain
silent longer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Huxter," he said, fixing his eyes calmly on
the face of his host, "you seem to forget that I am
your guest, and entitled to be treated with common
politeness."</p>

<p>"Mr. Oakley is quite right," said Mrs. Huxter.
"You have been very rude to him."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say I'm not polite?" demanded
Huxter, raising his voice.</p>

<p>It was not certain to whom this question was addressed,&mdash;to
John or his wife. But John, who did not
wish to get Mrs. Huxter into trouble on his account,
hastened to reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can judge for yourself, Mr. Huxter, whether
you have treated me as I had a right to expect. I
came here with you to oblige your sister, Mrs. Oakley.
When the business is over, I shall go back. I
suppose it will only occupy a short time. I shall try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to make you as little trouble as possible, and if you
will let me know the rules of your house I will try to
conform to them. To-morrow morning I shall be
downstairs in time for breakfast."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter would have been angry at these words,
but the secret thought that John was in his power
moderated his resentment. He laughed in his sleeve
at the thought of John's dismay, when he learned
that he was not here on a visit, but to remain for an
indefinite period. This fact he had not mentioned
even to his wife, who, therefore, could not help wondering
what could be John's business.</p>

<p>"You've made quite a speech, Oakley," said he,
sarcastically. "You may think it all right to charge
a man with impoliteness in his own house, but for my
part I think it cursed impudent."</p>

<p>"I do not intend to be impudent," said John.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you intend, but you are so,"
said Huxter.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't mind what he says," said Mrs.
Huxter, distressed.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Mrs. Huxter! I'd rather you wouldn't
interfere. I'll have it out with this young man without
any help from you."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Mr. Huxter," said John,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
with dignity. "I have tried to treat you with proper
respect."</p>

<p>"Yes, you've tried very hard."</p>

<p>"And I don't know why you have taken offence.
I should like to know how long I am likely to be detained
here on the business which has brought me
here."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Because I think it would be better for both of us
that I should go to the hotel, if there is one in the
village. I am afraid we are not likely to agree very
well, and then I shall not interfere with any of your
arrangements."</p>

<p>"Who do you expect is going to pay your hotel
bills?" demanded Mr. Huxter, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I think there will be no difficulty about that,"
said John.</p>

<p>"If you think my sister will pay any such bills you
are mistaken."</p>

<p>"As I came here on business of hers she will probably
pay it. If she is unwilling, I will pay it myself."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Huxter, pricking up his ears.
"Where will you get the money?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will not take offence, Mr. Huxter, if
I decline to answer that question."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you got any money with you?"</p>

<p>"I decline answering."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was about to make an angry reply;
but a moment's thought led him to change his purpose.
He was anxious to find out how much money
John had.</p>

<p>"Have you got money enough to keep you at the
hotel a week?"</p>

<p>"Shall I need to remain here a week?" asked John,
a little disturbed at the thought of having his studies
interrupted for so long a time, especially as there
seemed so little prospect of deriving any enjoyment
from his visit.</p>

<p>"Perhaps longer."</p>

<p>"If I don't have money enough, I will write to
Mrs. Oakley for more," he said.</p>

<p>"I can tell you beforehand that you won't get
any."</p>

<p>"We won't dispute about that," said John. "I
shall be glad to go about this business at once, as I
do not wish to be kept away from my studies any
longer than is absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking, young man," said Mr. Huxter,
"that it will be a good while before you go back to
your Latin and Greek."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why so?" said John.</p>

<p>"Read that, and you'll know," said Mr. Huxter;
and he drew a note from his pocket, and handed it to
John.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MRS. OAKLEY'S NOTE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John</span> opened the note, little suspecting the nature
of its contents. It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">John Oakley</span>:&mdash;I have made an arrangement with my
brother to have you board with him for the present. As
you and Benjamin find it so difficult to agree, it will be
much better that you should live apart. If you had not
treated him so brutally I should not be under the necessity
of sending you away from home. I hope you will give my
brother no trouble, but will follow his directions. He understands
what course I wish him to pursue with you. If
he reports favorably of you, I will send for you to return at
a proper time."</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Jane Oakley.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">"P. S. I will forward your trunk by express, early next
week."</p></blockquote>

<p>John read this cold and unjust letter with mingled
anger and dismay. It was hard to have all the
blame of his quarrel with Ben thrown upon him, when
Ben had been the aggressor, and he had only contended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for his just rights. So he was to be exiled
from home on Ben's account. He could not help
thinking how happily his father and he used to live
together before the present Mrs. Oakley came to the
farm as house-keeper. And now she and her son had
taken possession, and he was turned adrift. What
would his father have thought, could he have foreseen
what would happen so soon after his death!</p>

<p>These thoughts, and others not less disturbing,
passed through John's mind as he read his stepmother's
letter. Mr. Huxter's eyes were fixed upon
his face in cruel exultation, for he imagined the nature
of John's feelings, and enjoyed his sorrow.</p>

<p>"Well, Oakley, what do you say to that?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," said John.</p>

<p>"No, I presume not. The fact is, you haven't got
anything to say in the matter. My sister is your
natural guardian, and she has sent you to me to manage.
She says you're rather a tough subject; but I
reckon I can manage you. You'll find me a little
harder to deal with than a woman, I can tell you
that."</p>

<p>John did not reply. Indeed, he hardly knew what
Mr. Huxter had been saying. So many thoughts
crowded in upon his mind with regard to the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
change in his position that he paid little attention to
what was said.</p>

<p>"Is this the only business on which Mrs. Oakley
sent me?" he asked, at length.</p>

<p>"It's enough, isn't it?" demanded Mr. Huxter,
with a laugh. "So you hadn't the least idea what
was the object of your expedition?"</p>

<p>"No, I had not," said John, indignantly. "I had
no suspicion that it was only a trap."</p>

<p>"I knew you hadn't," said Mr. Huxter, laughing
with evident enjoyment. "You were pretty well
taken in, hey?"</p>

<p>"I was taken in," said John, shortly.</p>

<p>"Sister Jane was pretty cute. She knew you'd
be making a fuss, if you knew. I told her that once
I got you here there wouldn't be any more trouble.
So now you know all about it, and you may as well
settle down to staying here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter, to whom all this was news, listened
with earnest attention. She was a good-hearted
woman, and she couldn't help pitying John. She
liked her sister-in-law, now Mrs. Oakley, no better
than John did, and was very thankful when, after a
two years' residence under her roof, she had obtained
a position as house-keeper at a distance. She readily
came to the conclusion that John had been harshly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and unjustly treated, and she could not forbear expressing
her sympathy.</p>

<p>"I did not know you were going to remain with
us, Mr. Oakley," she said. "I'll try to make you
comfortable as long as you stay."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Huxter," said John, gratefully;
for he could understand the kindness which led her
to speak.</p>

<p>"You needn't mister him," said Mr. Huxter,
roughly. "It's ridiculous to call such a boy 'Mr.';
it'll make him put on airs worse than ever."</p>

<p>"I do not know his first name," said Mrs. Huxter.</p>

<p>"My name is John," said our hero.</p>

<p>"Then I will call you so, if you are willing."</p>

<p>"If he is willing! Don't make a fool of yourself,
Mrs. Huxter. It makes no difference whether he is
willing or not."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have you call me John," said
our hero, without regarding Mr. Huxter's brutal
speech.</p>

<p>John rose from the table. He had not eaten much,
for Mr. Huxter's coarseness, and the note from his
stepmother, had taken away his appetite.</p>

<p>"Won't you have something more, John?" asked
Mrs. Huxter. "You've eaten very little."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you. I don't feel much appetite this
morning."</p>

<p>He took his hat, and was about to leave the house
by the back door which led out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Oakley?" demanded Mr.
Huxter.</p>

<p>"I am going out for a walk," said John, shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter hesitated whether to obey the dictates
of the petty tyranny which impelled him to forbid
John to go out, but finally decided not to interfere at
present. He contented himself, therefore, with saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I expect you to return within an hour."</p>

<p>John made no reply, but his manly spirit revolted
against such contemptible despotism. He did not
recognize Mr. Huxter's authority, and did not mean
to. He resolved to take an independent stand at
once, and return when he pleased, and no sooner. I
wish it to be distinctly understood that John did not
expect, at his present age, to enjoy all the privileges
of a grown man. He was always respectful to rightful
authority, but he considered that Mr. Huxter's
authority was not rightful, and that his commands
ought to have no weight with him. Mr. Huxter did
not know the character with which he had to deal.
He did not know that John could be as firm under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
some circumstances, as he was compliant in others.
If he had known him better he might have felt less
confident of triumphing over him.</p>

<p>When he left the room Huxter turned to his wife,
and said, harshly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've got something to say to you, Mrs. Huxter.
You needn't trouble yourself to take that boy's part.
He is a proud-spirited young rascal, and he needs
taking down."</p>

<p>"He seems to me a very good sort of boy," said
his wife.</p>

<p>"That shows what a good judge you are," said Mr.
Huxter, with a sneer. "He's a young bully, and
was all the time fighting with Ben."</p>

<p>"I always thought Ben inclined to be a bully,"
said Mrs. Huxter.</p>

<p>"Well, he is a proud young upstart," admitted his
uncle, who had not forgiven Ben's disdain. "Got
some of the Brayton blood in him. But the other's
just as bad. It's six of one and half a dozen of the
other. However, wife," pursued Mr. Huxter, with a
change of tone, "it's likely to be a good thing for us.
We're to have six dollars a week for boarding young
Oakley."</p>

<p>"That's very good pay. I really think we ought
to make him comfortable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won't get much favor from me. I promised
Jane I'd break his proud spirit, and I'm going to do
it. I shall set him to work next week in the shop."</p>

<p>"Set him to work while we are getting six dollars
a week for his board!" exclaimed Mrs. Huxter, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what Jane told me to do."</p>

<p>"But his work alone will more than pay his
board."</p>

<p>"All the better for us."</p>

<p>"But I don't think, Mr. Huxter, you have the right
to do it."</p>

<p>"That shows how little you know about it. Isn't
Jane his guardian?"</p>

<p>"Does she agree to the arrangement?"</p>

<p>"Of course she does. She told me I might do it."</p>

<p>"And she will be willing to pay his board besides?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You see I represented to her that now she
was a rich woman she ought to do something for her
only brother, and that's the way she's going to do it.
It's a good thing for both of us. She gets rid of a
troublesome young rascal, and I get handsomely paid
for taking charge of him. It's a very simple arrangement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't seem to think it's right," said Mrs. Huxter,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Then you're a fool," said Mr. Huxter, not very
politely.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there'll be trouble," thought Mrs. Huxter,
nervously, but she did not reply.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MR. HUXTER MAKES A DISCOVERY, AND SO DOES JOHN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John</span> felt that he was in a difficult situation, and
he went out, not so much for a walk, as to gain time
to consider what he should do under the circumstances.
He guessed without much difficulty the reason
which had led to his banishment. Mrs. Oakley did
not like him, he was aware, and it was natural that
she should take measures to remove him from the
house. But John felt that, though this was one
reason, it was not the principal reason. He was
satisfied that she wished to have him out of the way
while she was looking for the will. But since the
discovery of the will could only be of advantage to
him, and strip her of two-thirds of the property, he
was forced to the conclusion that, if she found it, it
would be only to destroy it, or put it away where he
would never be likely to find it. He was thoroughly
convinced of this, but he asked himself in vain what
he could do under the circumstances. There he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
at a loss. He could not return and force Mrs. Oakley
to keep him at home, or if so, he well knew that
she would manage to make his position very uncomfortable.
Mrs. Oakley certainly had every advantage
over him. It would not be prudent, he knew, to
reveal his suspicion, for he had no proof to bring
forward. What should he do?</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley meant him to remain with her
brother; but he had already seen enough of Mr. Huxter's
petty tyranny and intemperate habits, to decide
that he could never be happy or ordinarily comfortable
with him. Of the two, Mrs. Oakley seemed
preferable. Mrs. Huxter, to be sure, seemed to be a
good-hearted woman, but she was a victim of her
husband's tyranny, and her well-meant interference,
without doing him any good, would very likely bring
her into trouble.</p>

<p>Finding his perplexity only increase, John adopted
a sensible resolution. He determined to lay the matter
before some one who was older and wiser than
himself, and be guided by his advice. He decided to
write to Squire Selwyn, his father's lawyer and friend,
who was already well acquainted with all the circumstances
of the case, and ask his advice. If he should
write at once, he calculated that an answer might
reach him by the fourth day, and until then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thought he could endure Mr. Huxter's disagreeable
manners. As to the will, he thought it more than
probable that it would never be found, or, if found,
it would never do him any good. If Mrs. Oakley
would carry out his father's plans, permit him to continue
his studies and go through college, he would
then be able to make his own way, and would not
trouble himself about the property.</p>

<p>While engaged in these reflections he had been
slowly walking up the road towards the village. It
was not much of a village, not more than twenty
houses in all, including a church, a school-house, the
tavern, and a store. Knowing something of the custom
in country villages, John rightly concluded
that the post-office would be found in the store. He
entered therefore, and looked about him. It was a
common country store, with a stock of a very miscellaneous
assortment of articles, from sugar and dried
apples to calico and tape. One corner was appropriated
to the use of the post-office. John walked up
to the counter and asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you any writing paper and envelopes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the clerk, producing the articles.</p>

<p>John bought two sheets of paper and two envelopes,
thinking he might have occasion to write two
letters, and then asked when the mail went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has already gone."</p>

<p>"When will the next mail go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me the use of your ink to write a
letter?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Just step behind the counter."</p>

<p>John followed directions, and, sitting down at the
desk, commenced writing. He thought it better to
write here than to do so at Mr. Huxter's, knowing
that the suspicions of the latter would be excited.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to transcribe John's letter.
He contented himself with stating plainly the situation
in which he found himself, and the manner in
which he had already been treated by Mr. Huxter,
and wound up by asking Squire Selwyn's advice.
Having concluded the letter, he directed it neatly, and,
prepaying the postage, handed it to the clerk.</p>

<p>"All right," said the latter. "It'll go to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>When this matter was disposed of John felt more
comfortable. He had transferred the responsibility
of deciding what he should do to another in whom he
had great confidence, and so felt a burden removed
from his own shoulders. He thought he could stand
Mr. Huxter's harsh treatment for a few days. Meanwhile,
with the usual elasticity of youth, he began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
feel an interest in the new scenes by which he was
surrounded. He had never before been so far away
from home, and though Jackson was not a very
attractive place, it was new, and so had a certain
charm for him. About half a mile distant he saw a
hill, which, though barren pasture land, would afford
him a good view of the village. He determined to
climb it, and look about him.</p>

<p>We must now return to Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>Half an hour or more after John left the house he
began to feel thirsty,&mdash;not that natural, healthful
thirst to which we are all subject, but the artificial,
craving thirst of one who has accustomed himself to
the drinking of alcoholic mixtures. Thanks to the
advanced payment for John's board which he had
received from his sister, he was unusually well supplied
with funds, and felt that he need work no more than
he chose. After splitting up a little wood, therefore,
he turned out of the yard, and walked towards the
tavern. He went into the bar-room, and received a
cordial greeting from the landlord, of whom he was
a pretty steady customer.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Huxter, where have you kept
yourself for two or three days? You haven't been
round to see me."</p>

<p>"I've been making a visit to my sister," said Huxter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's it. I began to think you had taken the
temperance pledge, and given up your old friends."</p>

<p>"I haven't come to that yet," said Mr. Huxter, in
a tone which indicated that he considered taking the
pledge a very discreditable proceeding.</p>

<p>"No; I thought you'd have too much sense for
that. What'll you have this morning?"</p>

<p>"Give me a glass of something stiff. Let it be
extra good, for I'm going to pay up the old score."</p>

<p>No doubt it was extra good, for Mr. Huxter drank
it with evident enjoyment, and immediately ordered
another glass. This, too, was drank, and after a little
desultory conversation Mr. Huxter left the tavern.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that his stock of tobacco was
out, and he went into the store hard by to lay in a fresh
supply. While he was paying for it the clerk said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You brought a boy home with you, Mr. Huxter,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How'd you know?"</p>

<p>"I saw him on the stage, and somebody said he
got off at your house. Going to stay with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've taken charge of him."</p>

<p>"He seems a good sort of boy."</p>

<p>"When did you see him?" asked Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"This morning. He only went out from here a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Huxter. "Did he buy anything?"</p>

<p>"Only two sheets of paper and two envelopes."</p>

<p>A light began to dawn upon Mr. Huxter. John
wanted to make trouble by writing home.</p>

<p>"Look here," said he; "if the boy brings in a letter
you needn't send it. Keep it, and hand it to me."</p>

<p>The clerk looked surprised. Mr. Huxter, finding
some explanation necessary, continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's a very troublesome boy. He's almost broken
his poor mother's heart,&mdash;she's my sister,&mdash;and
I've agreed to take charge of him for a time. It takes
a man to manage him. But it won't do for him to be
writing home and making a fuss. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have thought him so troublesome.
He looks very quiet."</p>

<p>"You can't judge from appearances," said Mr.
Huxter, shaking his head. "He don't show out before
folks. So, if any letters are put in directed to
Hampton, just keep them, and I'll look them over.
If they're proper to send, I will let them go."</p>

<p>"He wrote a letter here this morning."</p>

<p>"Did he?" asked Mr. Huxter, his eyes sparkling.
"The young rascal's prompt. It's lucky I came in.
He was cunning enough to write here, that I might
not know anything about it. Let me see the letter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The clerk, not doubting Mr. Huxter's authority,
handed him the letter.</p>

<p>He broke it open hastily, and read it. It is needless
to say that John's description of himself, though
moderately expressed, was far from complimentary,
and Mr. Huxter's heart was stirred with indignation.</p>

<p>"The young rascal shall pay for this," he thought.</p>

<p>"This letter is not fit to send," he said, aloud.
"It would only make trouble. I will take charge of
it. The boy needn't know but it is gone. You may
take any letter he brings; but mind you don't send it
till I have seen it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the clerk; but he could not help
pitying John, if he was to be under Mr. Huxter's
guardianship. In a small village like Jackson every
man's failings were a matter of general knowledge,
and the estimation in which Mr. Huxter was held was
not very high.</p>

<p>"Well, I've defeated the young rascal," thought
Mr. Huxter, triumphantly, as he left the store.
"He'll find it isn't so easy to outwit me. If Jane
can't manage him I can, and I intend to. I reckon
it'll be some time he'll have to wait for an answer to
that letter."</p>

<p>This thought amused Mr. Huxter, so that he partly
forgot his vexation at the unflattering description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
himself which the letter contained. Having no
further business to attend to, he went up the road
towards home. The letter he put in one of the side-pockets
of the loose coat which he wore. But there
was a large hole in his pocket, and without Mr. Huxter's
knowledge the letter slipped through. He kept
on his way, not suspecting his loss.</p>

<p>The letter remained unnoticed in the grass by the
side of the road, having been wafted there by the
wind, until John, on his way home an hour and a
half later, happened to catch sight of it. He went to
pick it up, not suspecting what it was, and was immeasurably
surprised when he found it to be the same
letter he had put into the post-office two hours before.
How came it there?</p>

<p>John was not long in guessing the truth. Mr.
Huxter was determined that he should not communicate
with any one in Hampton, and had recalled the
letter. No doubt he had given instructions to the
postmaster, which would make it impossible for John
to post any letters in future in the village.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to know this," thought John; "I
shall know better how to act."</p>

<p>He put the letter in his pocket, and kept on his
way, determined to keep his discovery to himself.
He began to see what sort of man he had to deal with.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Twelve</span> o'clock was the dinner hour at Mr. Huxter's.
John and he met once more, but the dispute
between them was not renewed. John was deliberating
as to what course he should pursue. Mr. Huxter
was secretly exulting in having defeated John's
attempt to communicate with his friends, little suspecting
that John knew all about it. So on the
whole he was pleasanter than usual, and allowed his
young guest to eat in peace. Mrs. Huxter was glad
to notice this change in his conduct, though she
hardly dared to hope that it would continue.</p>

<p>"So you took a walk this morning, Oakley?" said
Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"I went to the top of the hill behind the tavern."</p>

<p>"How do you like our village?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't tell yet. I haven't got sufficiently acquainted."</p>

<p>"You'll have chance enough before you get
through," said Mr. Huxter, significantly.</p>

<p>John understood this very well; but did not see fit
to show that he did so. He did not wish to provoke
a quarrel.</p>

<p>"I am going to write to my sister this afternoon,"
said Mr. Huxter. "Perhaps you'd like to send a
message."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John; "I don't think of any
message just at present."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like to send your love to Ben,
would you?" asked Mr. Huxter, jocosely.</p>

<p>"I don't think I should," said John, quietly.</p>

<p>"There isn't much love lost between you two, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"We are not very good friends," said John, in the
same quiet tone.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's no wonder," said Mrs. Huxter;
"Ben was always a troublesome, headstrong boy."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, Mrs. Huxter," said her husband,
sharply, "it doesn't look very well in you to run
down your own relations."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter thought it prudent not to reply.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Mr. Huxter, as they rose from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the table, "it's Friday,&mdash;too late in the week to begin
anything. You shall have till Monday morning
to look about you, and then we'll see if we can't find
something for you to do."</p>

<p>Here was a disclosure for John. He had understood
that he was to board with Mr. Huxter. Now
it appeared that the latter intended to set him to work.
Had he any authority for doing so, and what was
John's duty under the circumstances. He wished
earnestly that he were able to consult Squire Selwyn
without delay, and this reminded him that his letter
had not yet gone. It would be useless to leave it
again at the village post-office. It must go from
some other. John had all the afternoon before him,
and if the next town were not too far off, he determined
to walk over and post his letter there. Not
wishing Mr. Huxter to have any clue to his plans, he
decided to obtain the necessary information, not from
Mrs. Huxter, though he did not doubt her willingness
to give it, but from some other person.</p>

<p>He went out into the road, and began to walk slowly
in a direction opposite to that which he had taken
in the morning. It was the stage road he knew, and
was probably the most direct route to the next town.</p>

<p>Our hero had walked about three-quarters of a mile,
when he heard a loud clattering sound behind him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Turning around, he saw a farm-wagon, driven by a
boy of about his own age. It was but little past
noon, and the walk which might be a long one was
sure to be a hot one. As the boy-driver appeared to
be alone, and there was plenty of room for another,
John hailed him.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he called out. "Hold on a minute."</p>

<p>"Whoa!" shouted the boy, and brought his horse
to a stop.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the next village?" inquired John.</p>

<p>"To Milbank, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, who was not quite sure whether
he meant it or not, but was willing to take the risk.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going there. Don't you want a ride?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I was going to ask. I'm willing
to pay for it."</p>

<p>"I don't want any pay," said the boy; "I'd
rather have company than go alone."</p>

<p>"How far is Milbank?"</p>

<p>"It's a pretty good piece,&mdash;most five miles."</p>

<p>John was glad he had not attempted to walk.</p>

<p>"You don't live round here, do you?" asked John's
new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I thought I hadn't seen you. Whereabouts are
you stayin'?"</p>

<p>"At Mr. Huxter's."</p>

<p>"Is he a relation of yours?" asked the boy, looking
at John with interest.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," said John, hastily, unwilling for a
moment to have it supposed that there was any such
tie between him and his temporary host.</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay long?"</p>

<p>John was not surprised at these questions, for in
the country, where he had always lived, it was the
rule to be inquisitive about other people's affairs, and
he felt that he ought to make some return for his
ride.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall," he said.</p>

<p>He would like to have replied decidedly in the negative;
but he felt that he was by no means certain
about the length of his stay.</p>

<p>"How do you like Huxter?" asked his new
acquaintance, with rather a comical look.</p>

<p>"I've seen men I liked better," said John, smiling.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder," said the other. "He gets
awful tight sometimes."</p>

<p>"It is a pity," said John, "for Mrs. Huxter seems
to be a good sort of a woman, and it must be hard
on her."</p>

<p>"It would be hard for any woman to have such a
husband. I don't know Mrs. Huxter much, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
never heard anything against her. I've a great mind
to tell you," said the boy, looking at John to judge
whether he appeared as if he might be trusted with a
secret, "a trick that one or two of the fellows played
on Mr. Huxter once when he was drunk. But you'll
be sure not to tell?"</p>

<p>John, whose curiosity was somewhat excited, gave
the required promise.</p>

<p>"You see," continued his informant, "I was walking
along with George Sprague one afternoon, when
we came across old Huxter lying side of the road as
drunk as he could be. George is rather a wild boy, and
always up to some mischief or other. That afternoon
he happened to have a little red paint, which he had got
at the painter's shop for his father to use. As soon as
we saw old Huxter snoring away, George winked to
me, and said, 'Huxter's nose is red, but I've a great
mind to make it a little redder. I should like to see
how the old fellow will look.' With that he took out
his brush, and touched Huxter's nose with it lightly,
making it as red as a brick. I was afraid he would
wake up and chase us, for he's pretty violent when
he's drunk; but he was too far gone, and never stirred.
George took the paint home, and then we came out
to see if Huxter had gone home. We found he had,
and we afterwards heard how the trick came out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"When he got home and went into the kitchen,
Mrs. Huxter screamed as soon as she saw him.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter with you?' he growled.</p>

<p>"'O Mr. Huxter!' she said, clasping her hands,
'I knew that drinking would be the ruin of you.'</p>

<p>"'Then you're a fool,' he said. 'Drinking a little
now and then don't do me any harm; but you're a
woman, and have no more sense than a kitten.'</p>

<p>"'You don't believe me, look at your nose,' said
his wife.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter with my nose?' asked old
Huxter, a little surprised.</p>

<p>"'Look at it, and you won't be surprised at my
words.'</p>

<p>"With that Huxter did look, and when he saw his
nose glaring red, he was pretty well frightened, I can
tell you. He had no more suspicion than his wife
that any one had been playing a trick upon him, and
he was afraid that his nose would always be so. He
got frightened and went to bed, and then asked his
wife to go for the doctor."</p>

<p>"Did the doctor tell him how it was?"</p>

<p>"No; he thought it would do him no harm to be
frightened a little; so he lectured him about his habits,
but told him that he thought he could cure him
this time by using a warm lotion. It was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
but warm water, with something put in to stain the
water and make him think it was something else; but
Huxter did not know that, and was very grateful to
the doctor for relieving him.</p>

<p>"The fright had such an effect upon him that he
didn't drink anything for a whole week. Then he
began again, and got bolder by degrees, till now he's
as bad as ever."</p>

<p>"How did you find out how the doctor treated the
case?"</p>

<p>"Because George Sprague is the doctor's son.
The doctor told all about it at home as a good joke.
George heard it all, but never breathed a word to his
father about his being the one that painted Huxter's
nose. The doctor didn't say anything to George,
but he looked at him rather queerly, as if he had some
suspicion. It was a good joke,&mdash;wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"It would have turned out pretty well if it had
stopped Mr. Huxter's drinking."</p>

<p>"Nothing will do that. He's a pretty hard case
But you mustn't say a word about what I've been
telling you. It would get George and me into
trouble."</p>

<p>"No, I won't say anything about it."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"In Hampton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whereabouts is that? Is it far from here?"</p>

<p>"About eighty miles, I should think. It lies to
the north."</p>

<p>"Is it a pleasant place?"</p>

<p>"I think so; but then I was born there, you know,
and perhaps that is the reason I think so."</p>

<p>"Well, I was born in Jackson, but I don't think
much of it. I guess we'll move away next spring.
Father talks of selling his farm. What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"My name is John Oakley."</p>

<p>"And mine is David Wallace."</p>

<p>The boys now felt thoroughly acquainted, and
chatted together on a variety of subjects, such as interest
boys. While they were in the midst of their
conversation, they came to a grist-mill.</p>

<p>"I must stop here about ten minutes, to leave my
grain," said David. "The village is a mile further
on. If you'll wait I'll carry you there afterwards."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to go just on my account," said
John.</p>

<p>"I am going there any way," said David. "There
are better stores at Milbank than at home, and
mother asked me to buy her two or three things. So
you can come as well as not, and ride back too, if
you don't want to stay long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, David," said John. "I shall be glad
to accept your offer. It's rather hot walking, and I
shan't want to stop but a few minutes. Shall you go
anywhere near the post-office?"</p>

<p>"Close by."</p>

<p>"I'll just run in there a minute."</p>

<p>"Have you got anything else to do?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You didn't set out to walk just to go to the Milbank
post-office, did you?" asked David, in some
surprise.</p>

<p>"I had a letter to mail."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you mail it at our post-office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could; but it wouldn't go."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to tell you. You told me one
secret, and I'll tell you another, but on the same condition,&mdash;you
won't tell anybody?"</p>

<p>"I wish I may have my head chopped off if I do,"
said David, earnestly.</p>

<p>John felt sure that he could trust his new acquaintance,
though they had so recently been brought to
the knowledge of each other, and he wanted somebody
to confide in. So he gave David Wallace a
general idea of his story, not mentioning, however,
the will, as he could see no advantage in so doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"So Huxter thinks you don't know anything of
his having stopped your letter?"</p>

<p>"I am sure he does not."</p>

<p>"It's a good joke on him. He will never think of
your coming so far to mail a letter."</p>

<p>Part of this conversation took place after they had
left the mill, and were driving towards Milbank.
They were soon in the village. It was a much larger
and pleasanter place than Jackson, and much more
important also, being the county seat, and therefore
having a court-house and a jail. John looked around
him with interest, and did not dream how lucky he
was in taking this journey on this particular afternoon.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"That</span> is the court-house," said David Wallace,
pointing out a brick building, surmounted by a
wooden cupola.</p>

<p>John glanced at the building to which his attention
was thus called. He had hardly done so than he
started and uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded David.</p>

<p>"Won't you stop the horse?" asked John, hastily.
"I want to get out."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"There's a man I know. I want to speak to him."</p>

<p>David stopped the horse, and John sprang to the
ground. He hurried to the gateway of the court-house,
by which a gentleman was just entering.</p>

<p>"Squire Selwyn!" John called out.</p>

<p>Mr. Selwyn, for it was indeed he, turned in surprise,
and could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>"John Oakley!" he exclaimed; "is it really you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How came you here?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story, sir. Can you spare me fifteen
minutes? I had written you a letter, and was just
about to post it," said John.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will spare you that time. Come into the
court-house with me, and we will find a chance to sit
down."</p>

<p>"One minute, sir, and I will be with you."</p>

<p>John returned to the wagon, and said to the surprised
David:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the gentleman to whom I was going to post
a letter. I am going in to have a talk with him. I
won't trouble you to stop for me, but I can walk
home. I am very much obliged to you for bringing
me so far."</p>

<p>"How long will you be?" asked David.</p>

<p>"Half an hour perhaps."</p>

<p>"I shall be here as long as that. I will go on and
do my errands, and stop here on my way back.
Then, if you are through, I will take you along.
You would find it warm walking."</p>

<p>"You're very kind, David."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have company than not. It makes the
time go quicker. So go ahead. It's all right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>David started the horse, and John rejoined the
lawyer, who had been waiting for him.</p>

<p>"You say you were just going to post me a
letter?" said Squire Selwyn.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Of course you have it with you?"</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>"I will read it. That will be the shortest way
of getting at what you wish to consult me about.
After I have read it, I will ask any questions that
seem needful. But first we will come in."</p>

<p>They entered the court-house, and went into a
room to the left, where they found seats. Squire
Selwyn put on his spectacles, and read the letter
slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>"You are in a difficult position, John," he said,
when he had finished reading. "You are very unpleasantly
situated, I should judge."</p>

<p>"Very, sir."</p>

<p>"And this Mr. Huxter doesn't seem a very agreeable
man to have dealings with?"</p>

<p>"I should be very unhappy if I expected to be
obliged to stay with him."</p>

<p>"You say he is intemperate?"</p>

<p>"He drank several times on his way back in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
stage, and the boy with whom I rode over says he
has been intemperate for years."</p>

<p>"Certainly he is not a fit person to have charge of
you. Does he know that you have come over here
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"It is evidently Mrs. Oakley's intention that you
you should not be allowed to communicate with me,
or any of your other friends in Hampton. So, no
doubt, she has instructed her brother. There must
be some motive for this."</p>

<p>Squire Selwyn looked thoughtfully at John as he
said this, perhaps with a view of drawing out John's
opinion.</p>

<p>"I think," said John, hesitatingly, "that she is
going to look for the will."</p>

<p>"I won't say whether I agree with you or not,"
said Squire Selwyn, cautiously. "It is not best to
charge any one with wrong thoughts or intentions
too hastily, but it is well to be prepared for what
may be done to our disadvantage. Of course it is
for your interest that the will should be found, provided
the discovery is made public."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But would Mrs. Oakley make it public, if found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
when it is for her interest to keep it concealed?
That is an important question."</p>

<p>"She can do what she pleases so far as I am concerned.
She has sent me away from home, where I
shall know nothing that is going on."</p>

<p>"In one sense you are wholly in the power of
your stepmother," said the lawyer; "but you will
have some one to look after your interests. Your
father was my friend, and you are my son's friend.
I shall do what I can in your behalf."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said John, gratefully. "I
felt sure you would, and that is why I wrote to you
at once."</p>

<p>"As soon as I return to Hampton,&mdash;and that
will be to-morrow,&mdash;I will call on Mrs. Oakley, and,
without letting her know how I came by the information,
will set before her your present position, and
demand that she pursue a different course. The
result I will communicate to you. How do you wish
me to direct any letter I may have occasion to
write?"</p>

<p>"To Milbank, if you please, Squire Selwyn. If
directed to Jackson, I feel sure that it would fall into
Mr. Huxter's hands."</p>

<p>"And never reach you. Very likely you are
right. Then I will direct to Milbank, and will write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at once upon having my interview with Mrs. Oakley."</p>

<p>"Suppose Mr. Huxter ill-treats me in the mean
time?" suggested John. "I think it is his intention
to set me to work next week."</p>

<p>"Did he not say you were boarding with him?"</p>

<p>"That is what Mrs. Oakley said in her letter."</p>

<p>"Then if he is paid a full price for your board, I
do not see that he has any claim upon your services.
It is better, however, to avoid cause of quarrel until
you hear from me."</p>

<p>"And if you cannot induce Mrs. Oakley to change
her plans?" asked John. "You wouldn't advise me
to stay with Mr. Huxter?"</p>

<p>"Didn't your father have a married sister?" inquired
Squire Selwyn. "I think I have heard so."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Her husband kept a country store in
the town of Wilton."</p>

<p>"That is about fifty miles to the westward. Well,
though I don't in general approve of a boy's running
away, it might be advisable, should your stepmother
continue obstinate, and Mr. Huxter seem disposed
to abuse you, to leave here, and seek out your aunt.
Should you make this change, you would of course
immediately communicate with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you for the advice. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
thought of that before; but I think it is the best thing
I could do."</p>

<p>"Have you any money, John?" asked Squire
Selwyn, putting his hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; thank you. I have thirty dollars."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the lawyer, surprised. "Did
Mrs. Oakley supply you with so much?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but when my father was alive he gave
me an allowance of a dollar a week pocket-money.
I had saved up thirty dollars, thinking I might some
time want to make a large purchase,&mdash;a row-boat, or
something of that kind. When I came away with
Mr. Huxter, I thought I had better bring it with me."</p>

<p>"It is lucky you did so. You may have occasion
to use it. Does Mr. Huxter know you have this
money?"</p>

<p>"He knows I have some money," said John, "but
probably does not suspect how much."</p>

<p>"I advise you to take care of it then. Such a man
is not to be trusted. If he claims the power of controlling
you, he may demand this money."</p>

<p>"I don't think he will get it," said John, resolutely.</p>

<p>"I hope not. You were always a quiet boy; but
I have observed that you were not deficient in firmness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you don't think me obstinate, Squire
Selwyn," said John, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you that."</p>

<p>"If I find myself in the wrong I am always ready
to confess it and give up."</p>

<p>"That's right, my lad. It's a thing that some of
us who are much older than you find it hard to do.
By the way, I suppose you wonder how I happen to
be here so opportunely for you."</p>

<p>"I have been wondering all the time, but did not
like to ask."</p>

<p>"One of my clients placed some business in my
hands relating to property which required me to consult
the county records of this county."</p>

<p>"You didn't come through by the stage?"</p>

<p>"No, I thought it too long and tedious. So I
came by a roundabout way which left me only
twenty miles' staging. I travelled a greater number
of miles than you, but in considerably less time.
Now, John, is there anything more I can do for you
before I set about the particular business which
called me here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, thank you. At least I think of nothing."</p>

<p>"One thing at least let me say. We don't know
how this affair is coming out. Your stepmother may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
prove wholly unmanageable, especially as the power
is in her hands, as things are at present situated.
Should there come a time when you have need of
further money, let me know frankly, and I will see
what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind indeed, sir," said John,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"I certainly ought to be. When I came to
Hampton, a young lawyer and without acquaintances,
your father took me by the hand, and placed
his business in my hands, and influenced others to do
the same. So I consider that he laid the foundation
of my present prosperity, and therefore I shall not
desert his son while he is in trouble."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Squire Selwyn," said John. "I did
not know what you just told me; but I did know that
my father looked upon you as one of his most valued
friends."</p>

<p>"Well, John, good-by," said the lawyer, kindly,
extending his hand. "Keep up a good heart, and
something may turn up which may set matters right.
Be sure to keep me apprised of your movements, and
rely upon me to do what I can for you in Hampton."</p>

<p>John left the court-house much encouraged by the
friendly words of Squire Selwyn. He felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
would prove a powerful friend, and his burden of care
was diminished now that he had communicated his
situation to such a friend.</p>

<p>Just then David Wallace drove up to the gate in
his wagon.</p>

<p>"Have you got through your talk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just finished."</p>

<p>"Jump aboard then, and we'll be getting home."</p>

<p>"I've been pretty lucky to-day, David," said
John.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, in finding my letter by the
side of the road. But for that I should have thought
it had gone straight. Next in meeting you, and
being saved a hot walk; and again in just meeting the
very man I wanted most to see."</p>

<p>"There's one thing you forgot," said David,
roguishly.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The affectionate welcome you'll get from old
Huxter when you reach home."</p>

<p>"I don't count much on that," said John, smiling
in return.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've overreached the old fellow,"
said David.</p>

<p>"He thinks he's overreached me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it. That makes it all the better."</p>

<p>John reached his temporary home about four
o'clock. Mr. Huxter was not at home when he arrived,
and remained ignorant of the important interview
which had taken place between John and Squire
Selwyn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">ON THE TRACK.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the stage which conveyed John and Mr.
Huxter was fairly out of sight Mrs. Oakley entered
the house with a great feeling of relief. She realized
for the first time how she had been constrained by
the presence of her stepson. Though he had always
been respectful, there was an unuttered reproach in
his frank, fearless glance, which made her uncomfortable.
It was the tribute which a mean and wicked
nature pays to one of greater nobility, though Mrs.
Oakley did not acknowledge that. She only felt glad
that John was out of the way.</p>

<p>She had been so fearful that something might
happen to prevent the success of her plan, that she
had been careful not to make Ben acquainted with it.
She was apprehensive that Ben would, in his exultation,
lead John to suspect what was going on, and so
cause him to refuse going. Now that he was fairly
off she would tell her son the good news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Ben came down to breakfast late. He generally
had his way now, and was seldom present at the
regular breakfast hour. It was different when Squire
Oakley was alive; but then many other things were
different also.</p>

<p>"Benjamin is delicate," she said, one morning in
presence of the servant. "He needs more sleep than
the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's smoking cigars makes him delicate,"
suggested the servant, who did not particularly admire
Ben, or care to join his mother in making allowances
for him.</p>

<p>Her mistress silenced her with some asperity; but
nevertheless took an opportunity to speak to Ben on
the subject. But that young gentleman only laughed
at her remonstrances.</p>

<p>"It does me good, mother," he said. "I always
feel better after smoking a good cigar."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are growing pale," said Mrs.
Oakley, whose heart was full of tenderness where
Ben was concerned.</p>

<p>"That's all nonsense," said Ben. "I'm not as red
as a beet, and I don't want to be. But as to being
pale, I'm healthy enough. Don't worry yourself."</p>

<p>With this Mrs. Oakley had to be contented, for
Ben, though a coward with his equals, had sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
enough to take advantage of his mother's weak
partiality, and take his own way.</p>

<p>When Ben came down to breakfast on the morning
of his uncle's departure, he said in an indifferent
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has that man gone?"</p>

<p>"Do you refer to your uncle, Benjamin?" asked
Mrs. Oakley, not altogether pleased to hear Mr.
Huxter spoken of in that style, though she felt no
very warm attachment for him herself.</p>

<p>"I mean Mr. Huxter," said Ben, carelessly, breaking
an egg as he spoke.</p>

<p>"He is your uncle."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to call him so. I'm ashamed of the
relationship."</p>

<p>"He is my brother."</p>

<p>"That's your misfortune," said Ben. "All I
know is, that I hope he won't darken our doors
again."</p>

<p>"What have you against him?"</p>

<p>"He's a coarse, low man. He isn't a gentleman.
You're a rich woman now, mother. You'd better cut
his acquaintance. He won't do us any credit. You
haven't invited him to come again, I hope."</p>

<p>"I don't think he will come again very soon."</p>

<p>"He'd better not. How can you expect people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
forget that you were the late Mr. Oakley's house-keeper
if you show them such a man as that as your
brother?"</p>

<p>This argument had weight with Mrs. Oakley. She
wanted to be looked upon as a lady, and she acknowledged
to herself that Mr. Huxter's relationship
would be no credit to her. He was coarse and low, as
Ben said,&mdash;not because he was poor. Wealth would
have made no difference in him, except that it might
have enabled him to dress better. It would not have
diminished the redness of his nose, for instance, or
refined his manners. Mrs. Oakley, however, made
no comment on what Ben had said, but remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At any rate, Ben, your uncle has done us a good
turn."</p>

<p>"What is that, mother?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"John has gone with him."</p>

<p>"Gone home with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How long is he going to stay?"</p>

<p>"For good."</p>

<p>"How's that? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"John was in the way here. You and he could
not agree,&mdash;not that I blame you for that,&mdash;and
I did not like him. Therefore I made an arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with my brother to have John board with him. I
don't suppose you'll miss him much."</p>

<p>"It'll be a lucky miss," said Ben, emphatically.
"But John's rather stubborn. How did you get him
to go?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know he is to stay. I told him I
wanted him to go back with your uncle, in order to
attend to a little business for me. When he gets
there he'll find out what it is."</p>

<p>"Won't he rave, though?" exclaimed Ben, laughing
heartily. "He'll find it a healthy old boarding-house."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't use such language, Ben,"
said his mother. "It is my great ambition to see
you act and talk like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"So I do, mother. That's just the way they
talk."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley looked rather incredulous.</p>

<p>"I say, mother, is Uncle Huxter going to prepare
John for college?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley laughed&mdash;heartily for her.</p>

<p>"Your uncle's shoe-shop will be the only college
John will enter," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he is to peg shoes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"His pride will have a pretty hard fall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean that it shall," said Mrs. Oakley, compressing
her thin lips.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't envy John. Every dog has his day,
and he has had his. It's our turn now. Another cup
of coffee, and not so weak as the last."</p>

<p>"I don't think such strong coffee is good for you,
Benjamin."</p>

<p>"Oh bother, don't be a granny," said Ben, rudely.
"Anybody'd think I was a baby."</p>

<p>This was the way in which Ben addressed his
mother, who deserved his gratitude at least, for she
was to him a devoted and self-sacrificing mother,
however faulty might be her conduct towards John.</p>

<p>At length Ben's late breakfast was over, and he
left the house to resort to his accustomed haunt,&mdash;the
hotel bar-room and billiard saloon.</p>

<p>"I wish Ben cared more about study, and was
more ambitious," thought Mrs. Oakley, with a half
sigh. "If I could only make him feel as I do!"</p>

<p>It would have been fortunate for Ben if he had
inherited his mother's energy and ambition. The
ambition was not a noble one; but at least it would
have kept him from low haunts and bad associates,
which were all he cared about at present. Though
all his mother's worldly plans should succeed, this
was the point in which they were likely to fail. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Oakley's punishment would come in all probability
through the son for whom she was willing to sacrifice
justice and duty.</p>

<p>When Ben had left the house, Mrs. Oakley began
to concentrate her thoughts upon that which had first
led her to determine upon John's banishment. This
was the hidden will. She could not feel assured of
her position until that was found. Until now she
had not felt at full liberty to search. She had feared
that John might come upon her unexpectedly, and
divine her object. Now there was no fear of interruption.
She could ransack the house from top to
bottom, and no one would understand the motive
of her search. She had not communicated her intention
to Ben. She trusted in his discretion too
little to confide to him any secret of importance, for
she was a shrewd and prudent woman.</p>

<p>On this particular morning she had a feeling that
she had never had before. There was a confidence
that she had never before experienced that success
awaited her.</p>

<p>"I must and will find it," she thought. "This is
not a large house. Then there are some parts of it
that need not be searched. Mr. Oakley would never
have hidden his will in the servants' rooms, nor in the
kitchen. Everywhere else I will search. Let me go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to work systematically and thoroughly. This time
it shall not be my fault if it escapes me."</p>

<p>There was a small room on the lower floor, where
the late Mr. Oakley used to do the most of his writing.
This has already been referred to. Here he
kept a desk, and this desk more than once had been
searched by Mrs. Oakley. She determined to search
it once more, but only for form's sake.</p>

<p>"He did not mean that I should find it," she
thought. "Therefore he did not conceal it where I
should be certain to look first."</p>

<p>So, though she searched the desk, she was not disappointed
when this search, like the preceding, resulted
in bringing nothing to light.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," she said. "Where shall I
search next?"</p>

<p>She selected her own bedchamber, though here, for
obvious reasons, she had little hopes of finding the
missing document.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't place it under my very eyes," she
said. "Of course I know that. Still I cannot afford
to leave a single place unexplored."</p>

<p>The result justified her anticipations. So room
after room was searched, and no clue was obtained.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't put it under the carpet," she
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the thought seemed worth following up. She
got down on her hands and knees, and felt of every
square foot of carpeting in the several rooms to see
if she could detect beneath the pressure of any paper.
In one place there was a rustle, and she eagerly tore
up the carpet. But nothing was revealed save a
loose piece of newspaper, which by some chance had
got underneath. Disappointed, she nailed down the
carpet again.</p>

<p>Where else should she look? All at once a luminous
idea came to her.</p>

<p>John's room,&mdash;his old room, of course! Why had
she never thought of that? John, of course, was the
one who would be most benefited by the new will.
If by any chance it should be discovered by him, no
harm would result. His father would trust John,
when he would not have trusted her or Ben. Mrs.
Oakley could not help acknowledging to herself that
in that he was right. What strengthened her in this
view was, that among the articles of furniture was an
old desk which had belonged to Squire Oakley's
father. It was battered and defaced by hard usage,
and had been at one time banished to the attic. But
John, who was accustomed to study in his room, felt
that this old desk would be of use to him, and he had
asked to have it transferred to his own chamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
There had been no objection to this, and the transfer
took place about a year before Squire Oakley's death.
It had stood in John's room ever since.</p>

<p>When the new idea came to Mrs. Oakley, she
thought at once of this old desk as the probable repository
of the will. Her eyes sparkled with anticipated
triumph.</p>

<p>"I was a fool not to think of this before," she
said. "If the will is anywhere in the house, it is in
John's room, and in that old desk. At last I am on
the right track!"</p>

<p>With a hurried step she entered John's room.
Her hands trembled with nervous agitation. She
felt that she was on the brink of an important discovery.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MRS. OAKLEY FINDS THE WILL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Oakley</span> commenced her examination of the
old desk, thoroughly convinced that if the missing
will were in existence at all, it was hidden there.</p>

<p>It was one of those old desks and bureaus combined,
which were so common in the days of our
grandfathers. In the drawers beneath, John had
been accustomed to keep his clothing; in the desk
above, writing materials, and some small articles of
no particular importance. These he had not had
time to remove before his unexpected departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley turned those over impatiently, and
explored every drawer hurriedly. But she did not
discover what she had expected to find. This first
failure, however, did not surprise her. She did not
expect to find the will lying loosely in any of the
drawers. But she suspected that some one drawer
might have a false bottom, beneath which the important
document would prove to be concealed. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
therefore carefully examined every drawer with a view
to the discovery of such a place of concealment. But
to her disappointment she obtained no clue. The
drawers seemed honestly made. For the first time
Mrs. Oakley began to doubt whether the will were
really in existence. She had searched everywhere,
and it could not be found.</p>

<p>"I wish I could be sure," she said to herself. "I
would give five hundred dollars this minute to be
sure that there was no will. Then I should feel
secure in the possession of my money. But to feel
that at any moment a paper may turn up depriving
me of forty thousand dollars keeps me in constant
anxiety."</p>

<p>She gave up the search for the day, having domestic
duties to attend to. She tried to persuade herself
that her fears and anxieties were without foundation,
but in this she was unsuccessful. She permitted a
day to slip by, but on the second day she again visited
John's room. The old desk seemed to have a
fascination for her.</p>

<p>This time she turned the desk around, and passed
her hand slowly over the back. Just when she was
about to relinquish the attempt in despair, success
came.</p>

<p>Suddenly beneath her finger a concealed spring was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
unconsciously touched, and a thin drawer sprang
from the recesses of the desk. Mrs. Oakley's eyes
sparkled with the sense of approaching triumph, as
she perceived carefully laid away therein a paper
compactly folded.</p>

<p>With fingers trembling with nervous agitation she
opened it. She had not been deceived. <i>The missing
will lay outspread before her!</i> Mrs. Oakley read it
carefully.</p>

<p>It was drawn up with the usual formalities, as
might have been expected, being the work of a careful
lawyer. It revoked all other wills of a previous
date, and bequeathed in express terms two-thirds of
the entire estate left by the testator to his only son,
John. Squire Selwyn was appointed executor, and
guardian of said John, should he be under age at the
time of his father's death. The remaining third of
the property was willed to Mrs. Jane Oakley, should
she survive her husband; otherwise to her son Benjamin
in the event of his mother's previous death.</p>

<p>Such was the substance of Squire Oakley's last will
and testament, now for the first time revealed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley read it with mingled feelings,&mdash;partly
of indignation with her late husband that he
should have made such a will, partly of joy that no
one save herself knew of its existence. She held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
her hand a document which in John Oakley's hands
would be worth forty thousand dollars if she permitted
him to obtain it. But she had no such intention.
What should be done with it?</p>

<p>Should she lock it up carefully where it would not
be likely to be found? There would be danger of
discovery at any moment.</p>

<p>"It must be destroyed," she said to herself, resolutely.
"There is no other way. A single match
will make me secure in the possession of the estate."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley knew that it was a criminal act which
she had in view; but the chance of detection seemed
to be slight. In fact, since no one <i>knew</i> that such a
will was in existence, though some might suspect it,
there seemed to be no danger at all.</p>

<p>"Yes, it shall be destroyed and at once. There
can be no reason for delay," she said firmly.</p>

<p>She crossed the entry into her own chamber, first
closing the secret drawer, and moving the old desk
back to its accustomed place. There was a candle
on the mantel-piece, which she generally lighted at
night. She struck a match, and lighted it now.
This done, she approached the will to the flame, and
the corner of the document so important to John Oakley
caught fire, and the insidious flame began to
spread. Mrs. Oakley watched it with exulting eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
when a sudden step was heard at the door of her
chamber, and, turning, she saw Hannah, the servant-girl,
standing on the threshold, looking in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley half rose, withdrawing the will from
the candle, and demanded harshly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Shall I go out to the garden and get some vegetables
for dinner?" asked Hannah.</p>

<p>"Of course you may. You needn't have come up
here to ask," said her mistress, with irritation.</p>

<p>"I didn't know whether you would want any,"
said Hannah, defending herself. "There was some
cold vegetables left from yesterday's dinner. I
thought maybe you'd have them warmed over."</p>

<p>"Well, if there are enough left you may warm
them. I'll come down just as soon as I can. I have
been looking over some old papers of my husband's,"
she explained, rather awkwardly, perceiving that
Hannah's eyes were bent curiously upon the will and
the candle, "and burning such as were of no value.
Do you know what time it is?"</p>

<p>"Most eleven, by the kitchen clock," said Hannah.</p>

<p>"Then you had better go down, and hurry about
dinner."</p>

<p>"I can take down the old papers, and put them in
the kitchen stove," suggested Hannah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's of no consequence," said Mrs. Oakley, hastily.
"I will attend to that myself."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oakley seems queer this morning," thought
Hannah, as she turned and descended the stairs to
her professional duties in the kitchen. "I wonder
what made her jump so when I came in, and what
that paper is that she was burning up in the candle."</p>

<p>Hannah had never heard of the will, and was unacquainted
with legal technicalities, and therefore
her suspicions were not excited. She only wondered
what made Mrs. Oakley seem so queer.</p>

<p>When she went out Mrs. Oakley sat in doubt.</p>

<p>"Hannah came in at a most unlucky moment," she
said to herself, with vexation. "Could she have
suspected anything? If she should breathe a word
of this, and it should get to that lawyer's ears, I
might get into trouble."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley held the will in her hand irresolutely.
Should she follow out her first intention, and burn it?
A feeling of apprehension as to the possible consequences
of her act prevented her. The flame had
gone out, leaving the corner scorched, and slightly
burned; but apart from this the will was uninjured.</p>

<p>After a pause of deliberation, Mrs. Oakley blew
out the candle, and, taking the will, opened the upper
drawer of her bureau, and deposited it carefully inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
She locked it securely, and, putting the key in her
pocket, went downstairs.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, she went to the closet
in which she kept her wardrobe, and, selecting a
handsome silk cape, took it down with her.</p>

<p>"Hannah," she said, "here's a cape I shall not
use again. It doesn't fit me exactly. If you would
like it, it is yours."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said the astonished Hannah,
for this was the first present she had ever received
from her mistress; "you're very kind indeed.
It is an elegant cape."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a nice one. I am glad you like it."</p>

<p>"The mistress must be crazy," thought the bewildered
Hannah. "I never knew her to do such a
thing before, and I've lived here three years come
October."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">SQUIRE SELWYN'S CALL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Oakley's</span> door-bell rang, and Hannah answered
the summons.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Oakley at home?" inquired Squire Selwyn,
for it was he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Will you walk in?"</p>

<p>"I think I will. Let her know that I wish to see
her, if you please."</p>

<p>Hannah did as directed.</p>

<p>"Squire Selwyn?" asked Mrs. Oakley. "Where
is he?"</p>

<p>"In the parlor."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will go in at once."</p>

<p>"Has he found out anything about John, I wonder?"
thought Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sir," she said, as she entered the
lawyer's presence.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Oakley."</p>

<p>"Is your family well?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite well. My son tells me that John has been
absent from school for two or three days past."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is not sick, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You will excuse my questions; but his father
and myself were very intimate friends. Is he at
home?"</p>

<p>"No, he is not."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have no objection to telling me
where he is?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I have?" said Mrs. Oakley, coolly.</p>

<p>"Then I should think it very strange."</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to think it very strange," said
Mrs. Oakley, composedly.</p>

<p>"Why should you object to telling me that he
went away with your brother, Mr. Huxter, and is
now at his house?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley started in surprise. The lawyer was
better informed than she supposed.</p>

<p>"If you knew," she answered, after a slight pause,
"why need you inquire?"</p>

<p>"I wished to know whether you had sent him
away, intending to keep his destination a secret."</p>

<p>"I suppose he has written to you."</p>

<p>"He did write to me; but the letter was suppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by your brother. May I inquire whether this was by
your wish?"</p>

<p>"What you tell me is news to me," said Mrs.
Oakley; "but I have no hesitation in saying that
my brother understands my wishes, and will carry
them out."</p>

<p>"I am answered," said the lawyer. "Is it your
intention to permit John to continue his studies preparatory
for college?"</p>

<p>"It is not."</p>

<p>"It was his father's wish and intention. That
wish ought to be sacred with you."</p>

<p>"I understand my duty."</p>

<p>"I trust you will do something more than understand
it," said the lawyer, gravely. "I must remonstrate
with you on your intentions with regard to
John. He is an excellent scholar, and his abilities
are superior. It would be a great pity that he should
be debarred from the privilege of a college education."</p>

<p>"You say he is an excellent scholar," said Mrs.
Oakley. "Then, if his education is already so excellent,
there is no further need of his studying. He
can begin to earn his living."</p>

<p>"Surely you do not mean what you say. If he
were poor, and such a necessity existed, it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
well enough that he should go to work; but you well
know that no such necessity exists."</p>

<p>"I am not going to support him in idleness," said
Mrs. Oakley, coolly.</p>

<p>"As a student in college he would lead far from
an idle life," said the lawyer. "Study is hard work,
and college distinction is never won by a lazy student."</p>

<p>"It may be work, though to my mind it is not;
but it brings in no money."</p>

<p>"Not at first, perhaps, but it prepares the student
for remunerative employment in after life."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of colleges."</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Oakley said this, she would have
been very glad to have Ben in college, not that she
cared so much to have him a scholar, but it would
give him a good social standing.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Squire Selwyn, rather
sharply, for he was getting out of patience with Mrs.
Oakley,&mdash;"I don't know that it matters much what
your opinion of colleges is. It was, as you know,
the desire and intention of your late husband that
John should enter college. It is your moral duty to
carry out that intention."</p>

<p>"I don't care to be told what is my duty," said
Mrs. Oakley, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you propose to be independent of public
opinion?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mean your opinion?"</p>

<p>"Not mine alone. Let me tell you, Mrs. Oakley,
that in defrauding John Oakley of the privileges
which his father meant him to enjoy, you are wronging
the dead as well as the living,&mdash;not John alone,
but the dead husband from whom all your money
comes."</p>

<p>"He chose to leave all his money to me," said
Mrs. Oakley, "Probably he thought that I would
know how to dispose of it without outside advice."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure that he did leave his money to
you," said the lawyer, significantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley flushed. Could he know that the will
was found? Involuntarily she put her hand to her
pocket, where the will was at that moment lying concealed.
But a moment's reflection satisfied her that
Hannah, who had not left the house, could not have had
a communication with Squire Selwyn. Besides, there
was no probability of Hannah's suspecting the nature
of the document which she had seen in the candle.</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten that there was a will executed
three months before Mr. Oakley died," added
Squire Selwyn,&mdash;"a will by which John would have
come into possession of two-thirds of the estate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard a great deal about that will," retorted
Mrs. Oakley. "Undoubtedly my husband
destroyed it, as unjust to me."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it was unjust to you. It left the
property as the law would have left it."</p>

<p>"Very well, where is the will? If you will produce
it, I shall of course surrender to John all except
the third which comes to me."</p>

<p>"I wish I could produce it."</p>

<p>"But you can't," said Mrs. Oakley, triumphantly,
looking the lawyer in the face.</p>

<p>"In my opinion it has never been properly
searched for," said the lawyer. "I have the strongest
reason to believe that it exists."</p>

<p>"May I inquire what is that reason?" asked Mrs.
Oakley.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oakley, in his last sickness, spoke to John
about the will."</p>

<p>"What did he say about it?" asked the lady.
"This is the first I have heard of it."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately he was so low that he was unable
to declare where it was."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley looked relieved.</p>

<p>"But John heard the words 'secret drawer.'"</p>

<p>"Then you conclude that the will is still in existence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And where do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in this house," said Squire Selwyn,
emphatically.</p>

<p>"It is strange then that it has not been found,"
said Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I do not think so. If hidden in a secret drawer,
it would naturally be difficult to find."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley rapidly made up her mind what to do.
She saw that Squire Selwyn was suspicious of her.
By a show of fair dealing she could allay those suspicions,
and this would be worth while.</p>

<p>"If this will exists," she said, "it ought to be
found."</p>

<p>"So I think," said the lawyer, surprised to hear
her speak thus.</p>

<p>"And though its discovery would be to my disadvantage,
I certainly shall not object to a search. Are
you at leisure now to assist me in such a search?"</p>

<p>"I am," said the lawyer. "I think there is no
time like the present."</p>

<p>"Then let us begin in this very room."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be likely to be here. Still it is best
not to slight any possible place of concealment."</p>

<p>Assisted by Mrs. Oakley, Squire Selwyn commenced
a strict search, beginning with the parlor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and proceeding from room to room. He little suspected
how near him the document was all the time.
Of course the search proved fruitless.</p>

<p>"There is one room which has not yet been
searched," said Mrs. Oakley,&mdash;"the only one except
the kitchen, in which Mr. Oakley would be hardly
likely to conceal it. I mean my own room."</p>

<p>"There's no occasion to search there."</p>

<p>"I would prefer that the search should be thorough.
Here are my keys. I would rather have you go up."</p>

<p>Thus requested, Squire Selwyn complied with the
request. He returned from the quest disappointed.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," he thought. "I am firmly
convinced that my friend Oakley left a will in existence.
But where is it?"</p>

<p>That question he was unable to answer.</p>

<p>"I cannot find the will," he said.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have searched," said Mrs. Oakley.
"The fact that I have given you every facility for
searching proves that I am perfectly willing that my
husband's will should be carried out."</p>

<p>"And his wishes as well?"</p>

<p>"What do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"I refer to John's education."</p>

<p>"I have made up my mind as to that," said Mrs.
Oakley, briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you consider your brother's house a suitable
home for Mr. Oakley's son?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>"Do you think, in setting him to work in a shoe-shop,
you are doing as his father wished?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where you got your information,
Mr. Selwyn," said Mrs. Oakley, angrily, "but I must
tell you that you are meddling with business that
does not concern you. As you were my husband's
lawyer, and drew up the will which you thought in
existence, I have asked you to search for it; I have
even opened my own chamber to your search. You
ought to be satisfied by this time that you are mistaken.
In doing this, I have done all that I intend
doing. I shall take my own course with John Oakley,
who is dependent upon me, and whatever you
choose to think or say can have no effect upon me.
Good-afternoon, sir."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley swept from the room, and Squire Selwyn
left the house, feeling that his visit had not benefited
John in the slightest degree. That night he
wrote John a letter.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MR. HUXTER GETS INTO HOT WATER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Mr. Huxter's intention to set John to work
as soon as possible; but it so happened that the shoe
business, in which he was engaged, had been for some
time unusually dull, and had not yet revived. To this
circumstance our hero was indebted for the comparative
freedom which for a few days he was permitted
to enjoy. During that time he was waiting anxiously
for the expected letter from Squire Selwyn.
He wished to know whether his stepmother was resolutely
determined upon her present course with regard
to himself, before he decided to take the matter
into his own hands, and help himself in his own way.
Upon one thing he was fully resolved,&mdash;not to remain
much longer a member of Mr. Huxter's household.</p>

<p>As the letter was to come to the Milbank post-office,
on the fourth afternoon he walked over to that
village. This time he was not fortunate enough to
meet David Wallace, and therefore had a long and
tiresome walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there a letter here for John Oakley?" he inquired
of the postmaster.</p>

<p>"John Oakley," said the old official, looking under
his glasses. "Do you live round here?"</p>

<p>"I am passing a short time in the neighborhood,"
said John.</p>

<p>The postmaster took some time to adjust his spectacles,
and a longer time in looking over the letters.
John waited anxiously, fearing that he had
taken the long walk for nothing. But he was destined
to be more fortunate.</p>

<p>"You said your name was John Oakley?" repeated
the official, balancing a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, quickly.</p>

<p>"Then here's a letter for you. It looks like Squire
Selwyn's writing."</p>

<p>"It is from him," said John.</p>

<p>"Then you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, mechanically, impatiently tearing
open the letter.</p>

<p>"He's a good lawyer, the squire is," said the postmaster.
"He was here only last week."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him."</p>

<p>This was the letter which John received:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear young Friend</span>:&mdash;I called upon your stepmother
yesterday in the afternoon, hoping to induce her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
adopt different measures with regard to yourself. I regret
to say that I failed utterly in my mission. She will not
permit you to go to college, declaring that you have already
a sufficient education. Nor will she remove you from
the house of Mr. Huxter, though I represented that he was
not a proper person to have the charge of you.</p>

<p>"We had some conversation about the missing will. I
was a little surprised by her suggesting that I should search
the house for it. I was glad of the opportunity, and proceeded
to do so. I made the search as thorough as possible,
but discovered nothing. I still believe, however, that
the will is in existence, <i>unless it has been destroyed since your
father's death</i>.</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to advise under the circumstances.
If you should leave Mr. Huxter, I advise you to seek your
aunt at Wilton, and I shall be glad to hear from you when
you have arrived there. If you should need money, do not
hesitate to apply to me, remembering that I am your father's
friend."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your true friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">James Selwyn</span>."</p>

<p>"P. S. I enclose a few lines from Sam."</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">There was another sheet inside the envelope, on
which John recognized easily Sam's familiar handwriting.
He was very glad to hear from Sam, for
whom he felt a warm attachment.</p>

<p>Here is Sam's letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear John</span>:&mdash;I have been missing you awfully. I
couldn't think what had become of you till father told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
he had seen you at Milbank. So you are in the spider's
clutches, you poor innocent fly? A nice time you must have
of it with old Huxter. I declare I've no patience with Mrs.
Oakley, when I think of the way she has treated you. I
can't do anything to her; but I'll take it out in tricks on
Ben. By the way, your amiable stepbrother has got a
new friend,&mdash;a flashy young man from New York, who
sports a lot of bogus jewelry, and smokes from ten to a
dozen cigars a day, and spends his time in lounging about
the billiard and bar room. He isn't doing Ben any good.
They play billiards a good deal, and he tells Ben stories
about the city, which I expect will make Ben want to go
there. Do you think Mrs. Oakley will let him?</p>

<p>"You've no idea how I miss you, old fellow. All the
hard parts in Virgil and Xenophon come to me now. I
don't enjoy studying half so much now that you are away.
If I were you, I'd give old Huxter the slip some fine morning.
I only wish you could come and stay at our house.
Wouldn't it be jolly? I know father would like it; but I
suppose people would talk, and Mrs. Oakley would make a
fuss.</p>

<p>"Well, it's time for me to go to studying. Keep up a
stiff upper lip, and never say die. Things will be sure to
come round. One thing, you must be sure to write to me
as soon as you can. Tell me all about how you're getting
along with the <i>monstrum horrendum informe</i>. Of course I
mean old Huxter."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Sam Selwyn</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">John felt much better after reading these letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
He felt that, whatever might be the hardships of his
present lot, he had two good friends who sympathized
with him. He read over the lawyer's letter once
more. Though he didn't expressly advise him to
leave Mr. Huxter, it was evident that he expected
him to do so. John himself had no doubts on that
point. He felt that he would be willing anywhere
else to work for his living; but to remain in his present
position was insupportable. He could feel neither
regard nor respect for Mr. Huxter. He witnessed
daily with indignation the manner in which he treated
his poor wife, whom he sincerely pitied. But it was
not his business to interfere between man and wife.
No, he could not stay any longer in such a house.
To-morrow morning he would rise early, and, before
Mr. Huxter woke, bid a silent farewell to Jackson,
and start on his journey to Wilton.</p>

<p>When he reached his boarding-place, it was already
four o'clock in the afternoon. Mr. Huxter had come
home just drunk enough to be ugly. He had inquired
of his wife where John was. She couldn't tell him.</p>

<p>"What business has he to leave the house without
permission?" he growled.</p>

<p>"He is old enough for that, surely," said Mrs.
Huxter.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Mrs. Huxter! What do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
about it?" said her husband. "The boy needs a good
flogging."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he's a very good boy," said Mrs. Huxter.
"He is quite a young gentleman."</p>

<p>"He is altogether too much of a young gentleman,"
said Mr. Huxter. "He puts on too many airs
for me."</p>

<p>"You are not just to him, Mr. Huxter."</p>

<p>"How many times, Mrs. Huxter, must I request
you to mind your own business?" said her husband,
coarsely. "Do you know what I am going to do?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked his wife, with apprehension.</p>

<p>"I'm going to cut a stout stick out in the orchard,
and give the young gentleman a lesson when he returns.
That's what I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"Oh don't, Mr. Huxter!" implored his wife, clasping
his arm.</p>

<p>But Mr. Huxter was in one of his ugly fits, and
shaking off his wife's grasp, went out into the
orchard, taking out his jack-knife. He returned in a
few minutes with a thick stick in his hand, which
boded no good to poor John.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter turned pale with apprehension, and
earnestly hoped John would not return until her
husband had forgotten his resolution. But this was
not to be. She heard a step upon the threshold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
John entered by the back way. Mr. Huxter tightened
the grasp upon his stick, and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Where've you been, Oakley?" he demanded,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I have been over to Milbank," said John, quietly,
not knowing the intention of the questioner.</p>

<p>"What did you go over to Milbank for?" asked
Huxter.</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was any objection to my
going," said John.</p>

<p>"What business had you to go without asking my
leave?"</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose there was any need of my asking
you whether I could go or not."</p>

<p>"You're an impudent young rascal!" exclaimed
Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"What reason have you for calling me that?"
asked John, calmly. He saw that Mr. Huxter had
been drinking, and did not wish to get into a dispute
with him.</p>

<p>"You needn't think you can put on any of your
airs here. I won't stand it!" vociferated Huxter,
gradually working himself up into a rage.</p>

<p>"I don't want to put on any airs, Mr. Huxter,"
said John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean to contradict me?" demanded
Huxter, glaring at John.</p>

<p>"You had better go out," said Mrs. Huxter, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"He shan't go out! He shall stay," roared Huxter.
"I'll thank you not to interfere, Mrs. Huxter.
I'm going to flog the young jackanape."</p>

<p>He seized his stick and made a rush at John. Our
hero, knowing he could not cope with him, and besides
not wishing to get into a fight in the presence
of Mrs. Huxter, dodged the angry man. This made
Mr. Huxter, whose blood was now up, all the more
eager to get hold of him. John, however, succeeded
in eluding him once more. This time, however, Mr.
Huxter was unlucky. Mrs. Huxter had been washing,
and the tub full of quite warm water had been
temporarily placed upon the floor of the kitchen.
Mr. Huxter, whose motions were not over-steady,
slipped, and, falling backward, sat down in the tub.</p>

<p>He gave a yell of pain, and John, taking advantage
of the accident, ran out of the door. But Mr.
Huxter was in no condition to follow him. The
water was not hot enough to scald him; but it
certainly made him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"The young rascal has killed me," he groaned.
"I'm scalded to death, and I suppose you're glad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it, Mrs. Huxter. You put the tub there on purpose."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter took off his clothes and went to bed,
swearing at his poor wife, who he declared was in
league with John.</p>

<p>"There's no help for it now," said John to himself.
"I must leave this house to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">IN WHICH JOHN TAKES FRENCH LEAVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"To-morrow</span> I will leave Jackson," thought John,
as he undressed himself, and jumped into bed.</p>

<p>His spirits rose as he made this resolution. It had
been very irksome to him to feel that he was under
the control of such a man as Mr. Huxter,&mdash;a man
for whom it was impossible for him to feel either respect
or regard. Under any circumstances it would
have been disagreeable for him to remain, but off
from the studies in which he had taken delight, the
time passed heavily; he felt that he had no longer an
object in life. But the petty persecutions to which
he was subjected made it intolerable, and he was
satisfied that the accident which had befallen Mr.
Huxter would only make matters worse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Huxter, on his bed below, cherished
thoughts the reverse of agreeable concerning
our hero.</p>

<p>"I'll come up with the young rascal," he muttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
"He'll find it's a bad day's work he's done for himself."</p>

<p>"It wasn't his fault, Mr. Huxter," said his wife,
who wanted justice done.</p>

<p>"Why isn't it his fault?" said her husband, looking
at her with a frown.</p>

<p>"He didn't know you would slip into the tub."</p>

<p>"And I shouldn't wonder if you put it there, Mrs.
Huxter. It was a regular trap."</p>

<p>"I put it there just for a few minutes. I was
going to move it."</p>

<p>"Yes, after you had accomplished your object,
and got me scalded."</p>

<p>"You ought not to say such things, Mr. Huxter.
You know I was innocent of any such intention."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course nobody was to blame! That's
always the way. But it isn't much comfort to
me."</p>

<p>"I don't see how anybody was to blame."</p>

<p>"Well, I do," said Mr. Huxter, savagely. "As
soon as I get up, I'll give Oakley such a flogging as
he never got before."</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to Mr. Huxter that
he could not carry out his benevolent design at once;
but he felt too uncomfortable for that.</p>

<p>"I wish you had never brought him here," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Mrs. Huxter. "I am sure he cannot enjoy himself
much here."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether he enjoys himself or not,"
said her husband. "We get six dollars a week for
his board,&mdash;that's the main point. And next week,
when I set him to work in the shop, we'll make a
pretty good thing out of him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he will be willing to work in the
shop. He knows that you get paid for his board."</p>

<p>"I think I can persuade him with the horsewhip,"
said Mr. Huxter, significantly.</p>

<p>At that moment John's steps were heard as he
ascended the attic stairs on his way to bed.</p>

<p>A new thought came to Mr. Huxter about an hour
later. He reflected that it was in John's power to
elude his vengeance by escaping, and this he had no
intention of permitting.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Huxter," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want you to go upstairs, and fasten the
door of John Oakley's chamber."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"No matter what for. Go and do it, and I will
tell you afterwards."</p>

<p>"He won't be able to come downstairs in the
morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't mean that he shall. I'll keep him in his
room for twenty-four hours on bread and water. It'll
be a good lesson for him. Come, are you going?
If you don't I'll get out of bed myself, and go up."</p>

<p>Mrs. Huxter thought it best to comply with the
command accompanied by such a threat. Much
against her will, therefore, she went up and secured
the door of John's chamber by a bolt placed upon
the outside. She hoped that her husband would forget
all about it during the night, so that she might
release John before he had learned that he had been
a prisoner.</p>

<p>It was about half-past three that John awoke. He
did not know what time it was, but conjectured that
it might be near four. Though he still felt sleepy,
he deemed it advisable to lose no more time, but
escape while Mr. Huxter was asleep. He accordingly
dressed himself as carefully as he could, in the
imperfect light, and went on tiptoe to the door. He
tried to open it, but without success. Thinking that
the door might stick, he made another attempt. This
time he understood the state of things.</p>

<p>"I have been bolted in," he said to himself. "Can
Mr. Huxter have suspected my plan?"</p>

<p>Whether this was or was not the case John was
unable to determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down on the bed, and reflected what he had
better do. Should he give up the attempt, and go to
bed again? No; he was resolved not to relinquish
his plan while there was any chance of carrying it
out.</p>

<p>He went to the window and looked out. If it had
been on the second floor the difficulty would have
been less, but it was an attic window, and over
twenty feet from the ground. There was no ell part
beneath; but the distance to the ground was unbroken.</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck John. He turned up the
bed, and found that it rested upon an interlacing
cord. Why could he not detach this cord, and, fastening
it to some fixed object in the chamber, descend
with safety to the ground? The plan no sooner
occurred to John than he determined to carry it into
execution.</p>

<p>The rope proved to be quite long enough for his
purpose. He fastened one end securely, and dropped
the other over the sill. Looking down, he saw that it
nearly reached the ground. He had no fear of trusting
himself to it. He had always been good at
climbing ropes, and was very strong in the arms.</p>

<p>"After all," he thought, "this is better than to
have gone downstairs. I might have stumbled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
something in the dark, and Mr. Huxter would have
been roused by the noise."</p>

<p>He got out of the window, and swung out. He let
himself down as noiselessly as possible. In less
than a minute he stood upon the ground, under the
gray morning sky.</p>

<p>He looked up to Mr. Huxter's window, but everything
was still. Evidently no one had heard him.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," thought John. "Now I must
travel as many miles as possible between now and six
o'clock. That will give me a good start if I am pursued."</p>

<p>John hoped he would meet no one who would
recognize him. But in this he was disappointed.
He had walked six miles, when he heard his name
called from behind. Startled, he looked back hastily,
and to his relief discovered that the call came from
David Wallace, who had taken him up on his first
journey to Milbank.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, John?" asked David.
"Don't you want to ride?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John.</p>

<p>He jumped on board the wagon, and took a seat
beside David.</p>

<p>"You are travelling early, David," he said.</p>

<p>"Just what I was going to say to you," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
David, laughing. "Are you walking for your
health?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said John. "I've a great mind to
tell you. You won't tell?"</p>

<p>"Honor bright!"</p>

<p>"Then, I've left Mr. Huxter without bidding him
good-by."</p>

<p>"Good!" said David. "I don't blame you a bit.
Tell me how it happened."</p>

<p>David was highly amused at Mr. Huxter's adventure
with the tub.</p>

<p>"I must tell that to George Sprague," he exclaimed.
"It's a good joke."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mr. Huxter wouldn't agree with you
there."</p>

<p>"He never does agree with anybody. Now tell
me how you managed to walk off."</p>

<p>John narrated how he found himself locked in,
and how he resorted to the expedient of the bed-cord.</p>

<p>"You're a trump, John!" said David, slapping
him on the shoulder. "I didn't think you had so
much spunk."</p>

<p>"What did you think of me?" asked John, smiling.</p>

<p>"You see you're such a quiet fellow, you don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
look as if you were up to such things. But what will
you do if Mr. Huxter pursues you?"</p>

<p>"I can tell better when the time comes," said John.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't go back with him?"</p>

<p>"Not if I could help myself. I don't feel that he
has any right to control me. He isn't my guardian,
and he is the last man, I know, that my father would
be willing to trust me with."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see how he looks when he finds
you are gone. If you'd like to send him your love I
could go round by the house on my way back."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall need to trouble you,
David," said John.</p>

<p>"Whereabouts are you going?"</p>

<p>"I have an aunt living about fifty miles away. I
shall go there for the present."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry you're going to leave Jackson.
I mean I'm sorry I shan't see you any more. Can't
you write to me now and then?"</p>

<p>"I would but for one thing," said John.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid the letters would be noticed by the
postmaster, and put Mr. Huxter on the track. I
don't want to have any more to do with him."</p>

<p>"There's something in that. I didn't think of it.
At any rate I hope we'll meet again some time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I, David. You have been very kind to
me, and I shall not forget it. I don't know what
lies before me, but I shall keep up good courage,
hoping that things will come out right in the end."</p>

<p>"That's the best way. But I am afraid I must
bid you good-by here. I turn up that side road. I
suppose you are going straight ahead."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wish I could carry you further."</p>

<p>"It's been quite a help what I have already
ridden."</p>

<p>"Whoa, Dan!" said David, and the horse
stopped.</p>

<p>"Good-by, David," said John, as he jumped out
of the wagon.</p>

<p>"Good-by, John. Then you haven't any message
to send back to Mr. Huxter?"</p>

<p>"Not to him," said John; "but," he added, after
a moment's thought, "if you happen to see Mrs.
Huxter, just let her know that you saw me, and that
I am grateful for all she tried to do for me."</p>

<p>"You're sure she won't tell her husband?"</p>

<p>"No; she acted like a good friend. I would like
to have said good-by; but it wouldn't do."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll remember what you say. Good-by,
old fellow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by, David."</p>

<p>John estimated that he was now nearly ten miles
from his starting-place. The sun was already shining
brightly, and it promised to be a fine day. Our
hero began to feel hungry. The fresh morning air
had given him an appetite.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN IS PURSUED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Huxter</span> felt better after a night's rest. In
fact, his injuries had not been as serious as he wished
Mrs. Huxter to suppose. The truth is, he was a
coward, and even a small sickness terrified him. But
with the morning, finding himself very little inconvenienced
by his mishap of the day previous, his
courage returned, and with it his determination to
wreak condign vengeance on John.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Mr. Huxter?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"I feel like whipping that young scamp, Oakley,"
said her husband.</p>

<p>"He has done nothing that deserves punishment,
I am sure."</p>

<p>"Of course, scalding me is a very slight affair, in
<i>your</i> opinion; but I happen to think differently," he
said, with a sneer.</p>

<p>He drew on his pantaloons as he spoke, and seizing
a leather strap, left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Mrs. Huxter, "I do wish Mr.
Huxter wouldn't be so violent. I don't see what can
have turned him so against that poor boy. I am sure
he's very polite and gentlemanly."</p>

<p>She wanted to say more, in the hope of dissuading
her husband from his harsh resolution, but she dared
not. She went to the foot of the attic stairs to
listen, fearing that she would hear the sounds of an
altercation. She saw Mr. Huxter draw the bolt and
enter the chamber, but she was quite unprepared to
see him burst forth furiously a minute later, exclaiming
in a rage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's gone,&mdash;the young rascal has escaped."</p>

<p>"Escaped?" repeated Mrs. Huxter, bewildered,
for she could not conceive how John could escape
from a third-story room when the door was bolted.</p>

<p>"Ha, are you there?" demanded her husband.
"What do you know of this?" he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," said Mrs. Huxter. "I don't see
how he could have got away."</p>

<p>"You'll see plain enough if you come upstairs,"
said her husband. "He got out of the window."</p>

<p>"Jumped out?" gasped Mrs. Huxter.</p>

<p>"Slid down by the bed-cord, you fool!" said her
husband, who was too angry to be polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Mrs. Huxter, in a tone
indicating her surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you advise him to run away?" asked Mr.
Huxter.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"And did you know nothing of his going?
Didn't he tell you?" he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Not a word. But I'm glad he's gone,&mdash;I really
am."</p>

<p>"You're glad we've lost six dollars a week, are
you?" growled her husband. "You'd like to see us
starvin', I suppose. But you needn't be in such a
hurry to be glad. I'll have him back yet, and then
if he doesn't get the tallest kind of a flogging, that'll
sicken him of running away forever, my name is not
Huxter."</p>

<p>"You'd better let him go, husband. Don't go
after him."</p>

<p>"You'll oblige me by minding your business, Mrs.
Huxter. I shall go after him, as soon as I have
eaten breakfast."</p>

<p>Meanwhile John, feeling very hungry, as was
stated at the close of the last chapter, determined
to get a breakfast at the first inn on the road. He
had only to walk a mile further, when he came to a
country inn, with its long piazza, and stable-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
alongside. It had a comfortable look, suggestive of
good old-fashioned hospitality.</p>

<p>John walked through the front entrance, chancing
to meet the landlord.</p>

<p>"Can I have some breakfast?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Are you travelling alone?" asked the landlord,
who was a Yankee.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we can give you some. What
would you like?"</p>

<p>"I should like some beefsteak and a couple of
eggs."</p>

<p>"Coffee or tea?"</p>

<p>"Coffee."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"How soon will it be ready, sir? I've taken a
long walk, and am very hungry."</p>

<p>"You won't have to wait long. Here, Betty, just
get up some breakfast for this young man. Beefsteak,
boiled eggs, and coffee. As quick as you
can."</p>

<p>In twenty minutes John was told that breakfast
was ready. He was shown into rather a cheerless
dining-room, but the meat emitted a savory odor,
and he enjoyed the meal better, it seemed to him,
than ever before in his life. He rose from the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
at length with a sigh of enjoyment. Going into the
office he called for his bill.</p>

<p>"Fifty cents," said the landlord.</p>

<p>John produced a two-dollar bill, and the change
was returned to him.</p>

<p>"Not going to stay with us?" said the landlord,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>"No," said John; "I've got to travel further."</p>

<p>"Where may you have come from?"</p>

<p>"From Jackson this morning," said John.</p>

<p>"Did you walk? It's a pretty long stretch,&mdash;hard
upon ten miles."</p>

<p>"I rode part of the way."</p>

<p>"And where are you bound?"</p>

<p>John was beginning to tire of this persistent questioning,
and would have declined answering, but that
he feared this would excite suspicion.</p>

<p>"I am going to Redport," he answered.</p>

<p>Redport, as he had ascertained, was the next town
on the route. He did not think it necessary to mention
that he was going considerably further.</p>

<p>"Redport!" repeated the landlord.</p>

<p>"Yes. How far is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a matter of six miles. Are you going to
walk?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, unless I find somebody that's going that
way."</p>

<p>"I'm going over myself this afternoon. If you'll
wait till that time you may go with me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John; "but I don't think I
will wait. I've got pretty good legs, and I shan't
mind the walk."</p>

<p>"You can get over in two hours easy. Ever been
that way before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a straight road. You can't miss it."</p>

<p>John left the landlord's presence with a feeling of
relief. He had declined his offer for two reasons:
partly because he did not want to wait till afternoon,
but principally because the landlord would be sure to
ask where he intended to stop in Redport, which
would of course embarrass him.</p>

<p>John waited about half an hour, as he did not
wish to walk immediately after a hearty meal. Then,
having cut a stick from a tree by the roadside, he
went on his way.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after his departure, Mr. Huxter
rode up to the inn which he had just left. That gentleman
had procured a fast horse from the stable, for
the pursuit of the runaway. It was rather extravagant,
to be sure; but then Mr. Huxter felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
must have John back at all hazards. He could not
afford to let a boy escape who paid him three hundred
dollars a year, besides the work he intended to get
out of him. Then again, he thought, by proper representations,
he could induce his sister to pay all the
expenses attending John's capture.</p>

<p>"It's only fair," he thought, "that Jane should
pay for the team, if I give my time."</p>

<p>So Mr. Huxter sped along the road at a rapid rate.
He had taken the right road by chance, and having
met a boy who had met John and described his appearance
accurately, he had the satisfaction of knowing
that he was on the track of the fugitive.</p>

<p>Arriving at the tavern, it occurred to him that
John might have stopped to rest, if nothing more.
He accordingly descended hastily from the carriage,
and accosted the landlord, whom he knew slightly.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Huxter. Going to stop with
us?"</p>

<p>"I can't stop now. Have you seen anything of a
boy of about fifteen, rather stout built, who must
have passed this way lately?"</p>

<p>"Blue suit?" interrogated the landlord.</p>

<p>"Yes; have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you're after him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do. But have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he took breakfast here only an hour ago.
Son of yours?"</p>

<p>"No, he was my nephew."</p>

<p>"Run away, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's been acting badly, and I suppose he
thought I was going to punish him; so the young
rascal took to his heels."</p>

<p>"Sho! you don't say so! He paid for his breakfast
all right."</p>

<p>"You can judge how he came by his money," said
Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Well, he is a bad case," said
the landlord, who concluded, as it was intended he
should, that John had stolen the money. "Well, he
don't look like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a deep young rascal!" said Mr. Huxter.
"You'd think butter wouldn't melt in his mouth; but
he's a regular scamp. Which road did he take?"</p>

<p>"He said he was going to Redport."</p>

<p>"What time did he start?"</p>

<p>"Less than half an hour ago. He can't have got
much over a mile. If you keep on, you'll be sure to
overhaul him."</p>

<p>"I'll do that with a vengeance," said Mr. Huxter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you for your information, Mr. Jones. I'll
do as much for you some time."</p>

<p>"All right. Stop on the way back, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but I will. I only took a
mouthful of breakfast, I was in such a hurry to pursue
this young scamp."</p>

<p>"Well, it's an ill wind that blows nobody good,"
thought the landlord. "The boy's running away has
brought me two customers. I had no idea he was
such a young rascal."</p>

<p>"I might as well get a good breakfast," soliloquized
Mr. Huxter. "I can charge it to Jane.
She can't expect me to chase John Oakley over hill
and dale on an empty stomach!"</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter began to indulge in pleasing anticipations
of what he would do to John when he had
captured him, forgetting the good old rule, that before
cooking a hare you must catch him.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">THE VALUE OF A BOAT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> John was plodding along at a moderate
pace. He had no idea of the danger that
menaced him. He was now ten or eleven miles
away from Jackson, and this gave him a feeling of
security; not that the distance was so great, but that,
of the many directions in which he might have gone,
he saw no reason to think that Mr. Huxter would be
likely to guess the right one.</p>

<p>On the whole, John felt in very good spirits. It
was a bright, pleasant morning in September, with a
clear, bracing air, that lent vigor to his steps. He
decided to stop in Redport until after dinner, and
then inquire his way more particularly. He determined
to take the stage or cars, if he found any that
ran across to Wilton. The expense would not be
any greater, probably, than the cost of the meal and
lodging for which, if he walked, he would be obliged
to pay at the country inns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>He had got to the bottom of a hill when he heard
the clattering of wheels behind him, and was startled
by the sound of a voice only too familiar. "Stop,
you rascal!"</p>

<p>John looked round, and his heart made a sudden
bound when he recognized the well-known face of
Mr. Huxter projecting out of a chaise, which was tearing
down the hill at furious speed.</p>

<p>"So I've caught you, have I?" exclaimed his
pursuer, in exultation. "I've got an account to settle
with you, you young scamp!"</p>

<p>John was no coward, but he knew that in a physical
contest, he, a boy of fifteen, would be no match
for a man close upon six feet in height. Discretion
was evidently the better part of valor. If he could
not overcome his antagonist, could he elude him?
He darted a quick glance around, in order to understand
the situation and form his plans.</p>

<p>He couldn't keep on, that was evident. To the
right, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, he saw a
small pond gleaming in the sunlight. It might have
been a mile in circumference. Behind it was a belt
of woods. It occurred to John that he might find a
boat somewhere along the shore. If so, he could
paddle across, and Mr. Huxter would be left in the
lurch. If he found no boat, his chances would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
small. But at any rate this seemed his only feasible
plan. Mr. Huxter was already within a few rods, so
there was no time to lose. John clambered up on the
stone wall.</p>

<p>"Stop, you rascal!" shouted Mr. Huxter, as soon
as he saw this movement.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not," said John, coolly.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the worst flogging you ever had!"
said his pursuer, provoked.</p>

<p>"That's no inducement," said John, as he jumped
on the other side, and began to run across the field.</p>

<p>"I'll make him pay for all the trouble he gives
me," said Mr. Huxter, between his teeth.</p>

<p>He stopped the horse, and jumped into the road.
He would like to have pursued John at once, but he
did not dare to leave the horse loose, fearing that he
would not stand. Although chafing at the delay, he
felt that prudence required him to secure the horse,
which was a valuable one, before setting out after
the fugitive. "The more haste the worse speed,"
says an old proverb. So it proved in the present
instance. Five minutes were consumed in attaching
the horse to the branch of a tree. This done, Mr.
Huxter jumped over the stone wall, and looked to
see how far John had got. Our hero had already
reached the shore of the pond, and was running along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
beside it. Mr. Huxter's eyes lighted up with exultation.</p>

<p>"I'll have him yet," he muttered. "The pond is
in my favor."</p>

<p>He began to run diagonally to the point John was
likely to reach. But suddenly John stopped and bent
over.</p>

<p>"What's he doing?" thought the pursuer puzzled.</p>

<p>A moment revealed the mystery. Reaching the
top of a little knoll, he saw John jump into a boat,
rowing vigorously from shore. He was only just in
time. One minute later, and Mr. Huxter stood at the
edge of the pond. He was excessively provoked at
the boy's escape.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" he shouted, authoritatively.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," said John.</p>

<p>He rested on his oars a moment, and looked calmly
at his pursuer. There he was, only three rods distant,
and yet quite out of reach. Certainly it was
very tantalizing. If there had only been another
boat! But there was not. The one which John was
in was the only one upon the pond. John felt very
comfortable. He fully appreciated the advantage he
had over his antagonist.</p>

<p>"Come back here, I say!" screamed Mr. Huxter,
stamping his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should I?" asked John, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why should you? Because I'm your guardian."</p>

<p>"I don't think you are, Mr. Huxter."</p>

<p>"At any rate, you're under my charge."</p>

<p>"Suppose I come to the shore, what then?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"I'll give you such a flogging that you won't dare
to run away again."</p>

<p>"In that case," said John, smiling, "I think I'd
better not come."</p>

<p>"You'd better come, if you know what is best for
yourself."</p>

<p>"But I don't think a flogging would be best for
me," said John, smiling again.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was excessively angry; but he saw that
he was on the wrong tack. It was not easy for him
to change it, for he felt too provoked; but he saw
that he must do it, or give up the chance of capturing
John.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a little pause, "then I'll
pass over the flogging this time. But you must come
to shore. I want to go home as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"I am not going home with you," said John, composedly.</p>

<p>"Why not, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"I should never be happy at your house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're homesick. That will pass off."</p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't go back."</p>

<p>"Come, Oakley," said Mr. Huxter, changing his
tone; "you think I bear malice for the little accident
that happened yesterday. I don't mind confessing
that it made me feel ugly when I fell into that tub of
hot water. You wouldn't have liked it yourself,
would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I should," said John, smiling
in spite of himself, as the image of Mr. Huxter's
downfall rose before him.</p>

<p>"You can't blame me for feeling mad. But I know
it was an accident, and I forgive you. You know it's
your duty to come back."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said John.</p>

<p>"Your stepmother made the arrangement for your
good, and it's your duty to obey her."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oakley has not treated me as I had a right
to expect," said John. "There was no reason for
her sending me away from home."</p>

<p>"She thought it best for you," said Mr. Huxter,
condescending to reason with the boy, who was
beyond his reach.</p>

<p>"She took me from school, though she knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
my father wished me to remain there, and get ready
for college."</p>

<p>"She thinks you know enough already. You know
more than Ben."</p>

<p>"Ben doesn't care for study. He could have prepared
for college if he had wished."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you're right," said Mr. Huxter, with
wily diplomacy. "I didn't see it in that light before.
If your father wanted you to go to college, it's all
right that you should go. I'll write to my sister as
soon as we get home, and tell her how you feel about
it. So just come ashore, and we'll talk it over as
we go home."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter's words were smooth enough, but
they did not correspond very well with his tone,
when the conference began. John detected his insincerity,
and understood very well the cause of his
apparent mildness.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have you write to Mrs. Oakley,"
he said; "but there won't be any need of my going
home with you."</p>

<p>"How can you find out what she writes me?" asked
Mr. Huxter, subduing his wrath.</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Oakley is willing to have me go home
and attend the academy, as I have been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to do, she can let Squire Selwyn know it, and he will
get word to me."</p>

<p>"Does he know you are running away?" demanded
Mr. Huxter, frowning.</p>

<p>"No, he does not; but I shall tell him."</p>

<p>"Come, Oakley," said Mr. Huxter, persuasively,
"you know this is all wrong,&mdash;your running away, I
mean. I don't want you to stay at my house if you
don't like it, of course, but I don't like to have it said
that you ran away. Just come ashore and go home
with me, and to-morrow I'll take the responsibility of
sending you home to my sister. I can write her that
I think she hasn't done the right thing by you.
That's fair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>John felt that it would be fair; but unfortunately
he had no faith in Mr. Huxter's sincerity. He had
seen too much of him for that. He could not help
thinking of the spider's gracious invitation to the fly,
and he did not mean to incur the fly's fate by imitating
his folly.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be wise for me to go back,"
said John.</p>

<p>"I wish I could get at you," said Mr. Huxter to
himself.</p>

<p>"My sister will be very angry when she hears of
your running away," he said, aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said John, "I suppose she will."</p>

<p>"You must take care not to provoke her. You are
dependent upon her."</p>

<p>"That I am not!" said John, proudly.</p>

<p>"Didn't your father leave her all the property?"</p>

<p>"So it seems," said John, wincing.</p>

<p>"Then how can you live without her help?"</p>

<p>"I am old enough to earn my own living,"
answered John.</p>

<p>"Come, Oakley, don't be foolish. What's the use
of working for your living, when, by behaving right,
you can have a home without?"</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter seemed to forget that he had intended
to set John at work in his shoe-shop as soon as he
could obtain a supply of work.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid to work," said John. "What I
dislike is to be dependent. I am not dependent upon
Mrs. Oakley, for the property which my father left
was partly intended for my benefit, even if it was not
willed to me. If Mrs. Oakley intends me to feel dependent,
and breaks up all my plans, I will go to
work for myself, and make my own way in the world."</p>

<p>"Very fine talk; but you'll repent it within a
week."</p>

<p>"No," said John; "I have made up my mind, and
I shall do as I have determined."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you won't come ashore?" demanded Mr.
Huxter, his tone changing.</p>

<p>"No, I will not," said John.</p>

<p>"If I ever get hold of you, I'll make you smart for
this," said Mr. Huxter, now wholly throwing off the
mask which for prudential motives he had worn.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that you shall get hold of me," said
John, coolly. And with a sweep of the oars, he sent
the boat further from the shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was beside himself with rage, but perfectly
powerless to do any harm. Nothing is more
ludicrous than such a spectacle. He screamed himself
hoarse, uttering threats of various kinds to
John, who, instead of being frightened, took it all
very coolly, dipping his oars tranquilly in the water.</p>

<p>"There's one way of getting at you," said Huxter,
suddenly picking up a good-sized stone and flinging
it at the boat.</p>

<p>If he had been a good marksman the stone might
have hit John, for the boat was within range; but it
veered aside and struck the water. Admonished of
a new danger, John took several rapid strokes, and
was quickly free from this peril. Mr. Huxter shook
his fist wrathfully at the young boatman, and was
considering if there was any way of getting at him,
when an unexpected mischance called his attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in another direction. Looking towards the road, he
found that his horse had managed to break loose,
and was now heading for home.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" he shouted, as he ran towards the
retreating vehicle, forgetting that his voice would
hardly reach a third of a mile.</p>

<p>Certainly this was not one of Mr. Huxter's lucky
days. John was left master of the situation.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">ONE DISAPPOINTMENT FOLLOWS ANOTHER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of the last chapter we left John floating
at his ease in a row-boat, while his pursuer was
compelled, by the sudden departure of his horse, to
give up his immediate purpose, and chase the flying
animal. It was very much against his will that he
left John; but the horse, as he knew, was the best in
the stable, and valued at not less than three hundred
dollars,&mdash;a sum which he would be unable to make up.
Besides this, the chaise might be injured.</p>

<p>"Curse my luck!" exclaimed Mr. Huxter, as he
glanced back at John, with a baffled look. "Every
thing turns against me. But I'll come back after the
young rascal as soon as I catch the horse."</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for Mr. Huxter, it proved that
two legs were no match for four. When he got to
the road, the horse was half a mile ahead. In spite
of his haste, he was obliged to pause a moment and
recover his breath, which the unusual exercise of
running had exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Huxter was nearly two miles distant from the
tavern where he had stopped. His only hope was
that the horse would stop or be stopped there. As
soon as he recovered his breath, he started for the
tavern, therefore. Partly running, partly walking,
he at length arrived, tired, heated, and in ill-humor.</p>

<p>Entering the yard, he saw a group of men and
boys surrounding the horse and chaise, which had
already arrived. Among them was Mr. Jones, the
landlord.</p>

<p>"Why, here's the man himself!" exclaimed the
landlord, advancing to meet him. "How came your
horse to run away? Were you spilled out?"</p>

<p>"No; I tied him to a tree, and he broke loose and
ran away. Has he done any harm?" asked Mr.
Huxter, nervously.</p>

<p>"He's smashed one of the wheels in running
against a post," said a bystander.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Mr. Huxter, dolefully.</p>

<p>He found that it was as bad as had been told him.
The horse made a short turn into the inn-yard, and
managed to bring the chaise into collision with a
post. The wheel was pretty well shattered.</p>

<p>"Looks bad," said the bystander. "It'll cost
something to mend it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"It can't be mended," said Mr. Jones. "You'll
have to get a new wheel."</p>

<p>"What'll it cost?" said Mr. Huxter, with something
very like a groan.</p>

<p>"I can't say exactly. Maybe twenty-five dollars
will do it."</p>

<p>"It might have been worse," said the bystander,
in what was meant to be an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>"It's bad enough," said Mr. Huxter, fiercely.
"It's just my cursed luck."</p>

<p>"Was the carriage yours?" asked the landlord.</p>

<p>"No, I got it from a stable. They'll charge me
about double price."</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, did you catch the boy?" asked
the landlord, in a tone of interest.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Huxter, with an oath which I will
omit. "I had just overtaken him when the cursed
horse ran away."</p>

<p>"Well, you are unlucky," said Jones. "What
are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I must get the carriage home somehow."</p>

<p>"You might get a new wheel put on here. There's
an excellent wheelwright in the village. It will cost
you less."</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter finally made an arrangement to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
effect, the wheelwright agreeing for twenty-five dollars
to put the chaise in repair. This, with the
stable charge, made thirty dollars as the expense of
Mr. Huxter's little excursion, which, as we have
seen, ended in disappointment. He decided not to
continue the pursuit of John, having good reason to
doubt whether he would catch him.</p>

<p>There was one question which troubled Mr. Huxter:
Would his sister be willing to pay this thirty
dollars? If not, it would indeed be a bad morning's
work for him. He lost no time, on getting home, in
writing to Mrs. Oakley. His letter is subjoined.</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>:&mdash;I hope these few lines will find you in
good health. This comes to inform you that the young rascal
that I took to board to accommodate you has run away,
after treating me most shameful. I hired a team to go
after him this morning; but the horse ran away and broke
the carriage, which will cost me forty dollars to mend.
(Mr. Huxter thought if Mrs. Oakley was to pay the bill he
might as well add something to it.) As I was on your business,
you will expect to pay this, of course. You can send
the money in a letter. I will get back John Oakley if I can.
He is a young scamp, and I don't wonder you had trouble
with him. When I get him back, I will make him toe the
mark, you may be sure of that. Please write to me by return
mail, and don't forget the money. Your brother,"</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Ephraim Huxter</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Huxter did not have to wait long for an
answer; but it proved to be less satisfactory than
prompt. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>:&mdash;Your letter has just reached me.
I am surprised that you could not manage to control a boy
of fifteen. It seems that he has got the best of you. You
need not trouble yourself to get him back. If he chooses
to run away and earn his own living, he may, for all I care.
He is a young rascal, as you say.</p>

<p>"As to the carriage which you say was damaged to the
extent of forty dollars, I do not see how it could have happened,
with ordinary care. How did it happen? You
ought to have told me in your letter. Nor do I see how
you can expect me to pay for the result of your carelessness.
But even if I were to do it, you seem to forget that I advanced
you seventy-five dollars on John's board. As he
has remained only one week, that being deducted will leave
a balance of sixty-nine dollars, or perhaps sixty, after
taking out travelling expenses. I could rightfully require
this back; but I will not be hard on you. You may pay for
the damage done to the carriage (I am surprised that it
should amount to forty dollars), and keep the balance as a
gift from me. But it will be useless for you to make any
further claim on me for a year, at least, as I have large expenses,
and charity begins at home. Remember me to
your wife."</p>


<p style="text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Jane Oakley.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">"Well, if that isn't a cold-blooded letter!" said
Mr. Huxter, bitterly. "Jane is rich now, and don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
care for the privations of her poor brother. She
blames me because the chaise got broken,&mdash;just as
if I could help it."</p>

<p>Still Mr. Huxter had no real reason to complain.
His sister had agreed to pay for the damage done, and
there would be something left out of the money she had
paid in advance. But Mr. Huxter, as soon as he had
received it, had at once looked upon it as his own,
though not yet earned, and to use it seemed as if he
were paying the bill out of his own pocket. Then,
again, the very decided intimation that he need not
look for any more assistance at present was discouraging.
Deducting expenses, it would leave him but
a small amount to pay him for his journey to Hampton.
He resolved not to pay the wheelwright, if he
could possibly avoid it, not being very conscientious
about paying his debts. But, as Mr. Huxter's reputation
in that way was well known, the wheelwright
refused to surrender the chaise till his bill was paid;
and the stable-keeper made such a fuss that Mr.
Huxter was compelled to pay the bill, though very
much against his inclination.</p>

<p>The result of his disappointment was, that he began
to drink worse than ever, and poor Mrs. Huxter, for
some weeks, had a hard time of it. She was certainly
very much to be pitied, as is every poor woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
finds herself yoked for life to a husband wedded to
a habit so fatal to all domestic comfort and happiness.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN OAKLEY'S AUNT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> John found that his enemy had abandoned
the siege, he rowed ashore, and watched Mr. Huxter
until he became satisfied that it would require a
considerable time to catch the horse. He thought
that he might venture to pursue his journey, without
further fear of molestation. Of the incidents that
followed, none are worth recording. It is sufficient
to say that on the evening of the second day John
entered the town of Wilton.</p>

<p>It was years since he had seen his aunt. She had
been confined at home by the cares of a young family,
and the distance between Wilton and Hampton
seemed formidable. He knew, however, that his
uncle, Thomas Berry, kept a small country store, and
had done so ever since his marriage. In a country
village it is always easy to find the "store," and
John kept up the main road, feeling that it would not
be necessary to inquire. He came at length to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
meeting-house, and judged that the store would not
be far off. In fact, a few rods further he came to a
long, two-story building, painted white, with a piazza
in front. On a large sign-board over it he read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">
"THOMAS BERRY.<br />
<br />
PROVISION AND DRY-GOODS STORE."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"This must be the place," thought John. "I
think I'll go into the store first and see uncle."</p>

<p>He entered, and found himself in a broad room,
low-studded, furnished with counters on two sides,
and crowded with a motley collection of goods, embracing
calicoes and dry goods generally, as well
as barrels of molasses and firkins of butter. There
chanced to be no customer in at the time. Behind
the counter he saw, not his uncle, but a young man,
with long, light hair combed behind his ears, not very
prepossessing in his appearance,&mdash;at least so John
thought.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Berry in?" he asked, walking up to the
counter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Berry is dead," was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed John, in surprise. "How
long since he died?"</p>

<p>"A week ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"We never heard of it," said John, half to himself.</p>

<p>"Are you a relation?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"He was my uncle."</p>

<p>"Is your name Oakley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, John Oakley."</p>

<p>"Of Hampton?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A letter was sent there, announcing the death."</p>

<p>This was true; but Mrs. Oakley, who received the
letter, had not thought it necessary to send intelligence
of its contents to John.</p>

<p>"Didn't you get it?" continued the other.</p>

<p>"I haven't been at home for a week or more," said
John. "I suppose that accounts for it. How is my
aunt?"</p>

<p>"She is not very well."</p>

<p>"I think I will go into the house and see her."</p>

<p>John went around to the door of the house and
knocked. A young girl of twelve answered. Though
John had not seen her for six years, he concluded
that it must be his Cousin Martha.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Cousin Martha?" he said, extending
his hand.</p>

<p>"Are you my Cousin John Oakley?" she said,
doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I did not hear till just now of your loss,"
said John. "How is your mother?"</p>

<p>"She is not very well. Come in, Cousin John.
She will be glad to see you."</p>

<p>John was ushered into a small sitting-room, where
he found his aunt seated in a chair by the window,
sewing on a black dress for one of the children.</p>

<p>"Here's Cousin John, mother," said Martha.</p>

<p>An expression of pleasure came to Mrs. Berry's
pale face.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, John," she said.
"You were very kind to come. Is your stepmother
well?"</p>

<p>"Quite well," said John. "But I do not come
directly from home."</p>

<p>"Indeed! How does that happen?" asked his
aunt.</p>

<p>"It is rather a long story, aunt. I will tell you
by and by. But now tell me about yourself. Of
what did my uncle die?"</p>

<p>"He exposed himself imprudently in a storm one
evening three months since," said Mrs. Berry. "In
consequence of this, he took a severe cold, which
finally terminated in a fever. We did not at first
suppose him to be in any danger, but he gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
became worse, and a week since he died. It is a
terrible loss to me and my poor children."</p>

<p>Here his aunt put her handkerchief to her face to
wipe away the tears that started at the thought of
her bereavement.</p>

<p>"Dear aunt, I sympathize with you," said John,
earnestly, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"I know you do, John," said his aunt. "I don't
know how I can get along alone, with four poor
fatherless children to look after."</p>

<p>"God will help you, aunt. You must look to
him," said John, reverently.</p>

<p>"It is that thought alone that sustains me," said
Mrs. Berry. "But sometimes, when the thought of
my bereavement comes upon me, I don't realize it
as I should."</p>

<p>"I went into the store first," said John. "I suppose
it was my uncle's assistant that I saw there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Berry; "it was Mr. Hall."</p>

<p>"I suppose he manages the store now for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Berry, slowly. "But I hardly
know that it is right to say that he manages it for
me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked John, perplexed by his aunt's
manner, which seemed to him strange.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, John," said his aunt. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Mr. Berry died, I thought he owned the stock clear,
and had no debts; but day before yesterday Mr.
Hall called in, and showed me a note for two thousand
dollars, signed by Mr. Berry. I don't suppose
the stock is worth more than three thousand. Of
course that makes a very great difference in my circumstances.
In fact, it will leave me only a thousand
dollars, at the utmost, to support my poor children.
I don't know what I shall do." And the poor woman,
whose nerves had been shaken by her grief, burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Didn't my uncle own this building, then?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"No, he never owned it. He hired it at a low rent
from Mr. Mansfield, one of the selectmen, and a rich
man."</p>

<p>"Can't you keep up the store, aunt? Will not
that give income enough to support the family?"</p>

<p>"But for this note, I could. But if I have to pay
that, it will leave only a third of the store belonging
to me. Then out of the profits I must pay the rent,
the wages of a salesman and a boy, before I can get
anything for myself. You see, John, there isn't
much prospect."</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, thoughtfully. "It doesn't look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
very bright. You say, aunt, that uncle never
mentioned this note to you?"</p>

<p>"He never mentioned a syllable about it."</p>

<p>"Did he generally mention his affairs to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he wasn't one of those husbands that keep
everything secret from their wives. He always told
me how he was getting along."</p>

<p>"When was the note dated?"</p>

<p>"A year and a half ago."</p>

<p>"Do you know whether my uncle had any particular
use for so large a sum of money at that time?"</p>

<p>"No. That is what puzzles me," said Mrs. Berry.
"If he got the money, I am sure I don't know what
he did with it."</p>

<p>"Did he extend his business with it, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure he did not. His stock is no larger
now than it was six years ago. He always calculated
to keep it at about the same amount."</p>

<p>"That seems strange," said John,&mdash;"that we can't
find where the money went to, I mean; especially
as it was so large a sum."</p>

<p>"Yes, John, that is what I think. There's some
mystery about it. I've thought and thought, and I
can't tell how it happened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"What sort of a man is Mr. Hall?" asked John,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything against him," said Mrs.
Berry.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it is," said John, "but I don't
like his looks. I took rather a prejudice against him
when I saw him just now."</p>

<p>"I never liked him," said his aunt, "though I
can't give any good reason for my dislike. He
never treated me in any way of which I could complain."</p>

<p>"How long has he been in the store?"</p>

<p>"How long is it, Martha?" asked Mrs. Berry,
turning to her oldest daughter, who, by the way, was
a very pretty girl, with blooming cheeks and dark,
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"It will be four years in October, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember now."</p>

<p>"He seems quite a young man."</p>

<p>"I think he is twenty-three."</p>

<p>"Does he get a large salary?"</p>

<p>"No, only forty dollars a month."</p>

<p>"Did you know of his having any property when
he came here?"</p>

<p>"No; he seemed quite poor."</p>

<p>"Then I don't understand where he could have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the two thousand dollars which he says he loaned
uncle."</p>

<p>"I declare, John, you are right," said Mrs. Berry,
looking as if new light was thrown over the matter.
"It certainly does look very strange. I wonder I
didn't think of it before; but I have had so much to
think of, that I couldn't think properly of anything.
How do you account for it, John?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, aunt," said John, quietly. "I
think the note is a forgery, and that Mr. Hall means
to cheat you out of two-thirds of your property."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">JOHN MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">"Do</span> you really believe this, John?" asked Mrs.
Berry, in excitement.</p>

<p>"I really do, aunt. I see no other way to account
for the existence of the note."</p>

<p>"But the signature looked like Mr. Berry's," said
his aunt, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Did you examine it carefully, aunt?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," admitted Mrs. Berry.</p>

<p>"I should like to compare it with uncle's handwriting."</p>

<p>"I suppose Mr. Hall would think it strange if I
should ask him to let me take it."</p>

<p>"Yes; but he must do it, if he wants the note
acknowledged."</p>

<p>"I have no head for business," said Mrs. Berry.
"A child could cheat me. I wish you could stay
with me and look after things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"But will your mother be willing?"</p>

<p>"I have no mother," said John.</p>

<p>"Your stepmother, then?"</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you, aunt, that there has
been a serious difficulty between Mrs. Oakley and
myself, and I have left home."</p>

<p>"Is it possible, John? Didn't your stepmother
treat you right?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it, aunt, and you shall
judge."</p>

<p>It was a long story, but, as we already know all
about it, it is unnecessary to give John's account.
His aunt listened attentively, and sympathized fully
with John in the matter.</p>

<p>"You have been badly treated, John," she said.
"I am sure my poor brother would feel badly
enough if he could know how Mrs. Oakley has driven
you from home. You do not mean to go back?"</p>

<p>"No, aunt," said John, resolutely. "Until Mrs.
Oakley restores me to my former privileges, I shall
not go home."</p>

<p>"Then you must stay here, John," said his
aunt.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you, aunt, I will."</p>

<p>"You can be of great service to me, John. I do
not feel confidence in Mr. Hall, and you know why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
I cannot be sure that he is not cheating me in the
store. I want you to keep an eye upon him."</p>

<p>"I will go into the store as an assistant," said
John. "That will give me the best opportunity."</p>

<p>"But you have never been used to work," said his
aunt.</p>

<p>"I must work now. Remember, aunt, Mrs. Oakley
holds the property, and I am dependent on my
own exertions."</p>

<p>"It is disgraceful that it should be so, John."</p>

<p>"But it is so. Perhaps matters may come right
by and by; but for the present I must work. I will
go into the store, and you shall give me my board."</p>

<p>"You will earn more than that, John."</p>

<p>"If we get clear of Mr. Hall's note, you can do
better by me. Until then, let that be the arrangement."</p>

<p>"You don't know what a load you have lifted from
my mind, John. I am very sorry that you have been
driven from home; but I am very glad to have you
here. Martha, get ready the back bedroom for
John."</p>

<p>"I begin to feel myself at home already," said
John, brightly.</p>

<p>"Our home is a humble one compared with the
one you have left, John," said his aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you are here, aunt, and you seem like my
own mother. That will make more than the difference
to me."</p>

<p>"I hope we can make you comfortable, John.
Martha, you may set the table for supper, and get
John's room ready afterwards. I think he must be
hungry."</p>

<p>"I am as hungry as a bear, aunt," said John,
smiling.</p>

<p>In the evening Martha went into the store by her
mother's request, and asked Mr. Hall to step in after
closing the store.</p>

<p>He did so.</p>

<p>"I believe you wished to see me, Mrs. Berry," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hall. Will you sit down?"</p>

<p>"Thank you." And the young man seated himself,
looking furtively at Mrs. Berry, as if to inquire
the object of his being summoned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hall, this is my nephew, John Oakley. I
believe you have already met."</p>

<p>"Yes, he came into the store," said Mr. Hall,
glancing at John.</p>

<p>"He has agreed to remain here for the present,
and will assist you in the store."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hall looked as if he was not pleased with this
intelligence.</p>

<p>"I do not think that I shall need any assistance,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I am surprised to hear that," said Mrs. Berry.
"Certainly you cannot expect to do alone the business
which formerly required Mr. Berry and yourself
to do."</p>

<p>"The business is not so large as it was," said
Hall.</p>

<p>"Then you must try to bring it up to where it
used to be. You must remember that I have a
young family to support, and it will require an effort
to do it."</p>

<p>"That is why I thought it would be better to save
the wages of an extra clerk," said Hall.</p>

<p>"You are considerate, especially as it would require
you to work harder yourself. But my nephew
knows my circumstances, and does not wish large
compensation."</p>

<p>"Has he any experience in tending store?" asked
Hall.</p>

<p>"No," said John.</p>

<p>"Then I should have to teach you. It would be
more trouble than the help I would get."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would find me so hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
learn," said John, quietly. "I have always lived in
the country, and know something about the business
of a country store. I don't think I shall be long in
learning."</p>

<p>"I agree with John," said Mrs. Berry.</p>

<p>"Of course it must be as you say," said Mr. Hall,
appearing dissatisfied; "but I hoped to save you the
expense. And I cannot say I think any help necessary;
or, if it were, it would be better, with all respect
to Mr. Oakley, to take James Sanford, who has
had some experience at Trafton."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Hall," said John, taking no
notice of the opposition, "then I will come in to-morrow
morning. What time do you open the
store?"</p>

<p>"At six o'clock."</p>

<p>"Won't that be rather early for you, John?"
asked his aunt.</p>

<p>"You are making me out to be lazy, aunt," said
John.</p>

<p>"There isn't much business early in the morning,"
said Hall. "You need not come till seven."</p>

<p>"I would rather go early," said John. "I want
to learn the business as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Did you wish to speak about anything else, Mrs.
Berry?" said Mr. Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hall; but you need not be in haste."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I am feeling rather tired."</p>

<p>"Good-night, then."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said John, when they were
alone, "that Mr. Hall did not much want me to
enter the store."</p>

<p>"No; I was surprised at that. It must be very
hard for one."</p>

<p>"I have my thoughts about it," said John.</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked his aunt.</p>

<p>"I will not say anything now. They may amount
to nothing. But I think Mr. Hall is afraid I will
find out something, and therefore he objects to my
going into the store. I shall keep good watch, and
if I find out anything I will let you know."</p>

<p>"I think you must be tired, John. You can go to
bed when you please."</p>

<p>"Then I think I will go now, particularly as I am
to be up by six in the morning."</p>

<p>"Never mind about to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I had better begin as I am going to hold out,
aunt. Good-night."</p>

<p>John took the lamp and entered his bedchamber
with a happier and more home-like feeling than he
had had for months. He felt so interested in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
aunt's troubles that he almost forgot that he had any
of his own.</p>

<p>In the morning, as the village clock struck six,
John stood in front of the store. A minute later,
Mr. Hall, who boarded at a little distance, came up.
He greeted John coldly, and they entered.</p>

<p>"Now I hope you will make me useful," said
John.</p>

<p>"You may sweep out," said Hall.</p>

<p>"Where shall I find the broom?"</p>

<p>Hall told him and John commenced. It was new
work to him, but he did it well, and then went to
work to arrange things a little more neatly. Occasionally
he asked information of Mr. Hall, which
was ungraciously given. Still John learned rapidly,
and in a fortnight had learned as much as many boys
in three months.</p>

<p>One day, when Hall was gone to dinner, John
chanced to open the stove, in which there had been
no fire for the summer months. It was full of papers
and letters of various kinds, which had been crowded
into it, as a convenient receptacle. It was so full
that, on the door being opened, a considerable
portion fell on the floor. John began to pick them
up, and, in doing so, naturally looked at some of the
papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once he started with excitement as a particular
paper caught his attention. He read it eagerly,
and his eyes lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I must show this to my aunt," he said. "I suspected
that note of Mr. Hall's was a forgery, and
now I feel sure of it."</p>

<p>He carefully deposited the paper in his pocket-book,
and, putting back the rest of the papers, shut
the stove door, and resumed his place behind the
counter, just as Mr. Hall returned from dinner.</p>

<p>He little guessed that John had made a discovery
of the utmost consequence to him.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MR. HALL'S DISCOMFITURE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> paper which John had discovered among the
rubbish in the stove was a half sheet of foolscap,
which was covered with imitations of Mr. Berry's
handwriting, the words occurring being those of the
note of hand which Hall had presented for payment.
The first attempts were inexact, but those further
down, with which pains had evidently been taken,
were close copies of Mr. Berry's usual handwriting.
This of course John could not know, not being familiar
with his uncle's hand, but his aunt confirmed it.</p>

<p>"It is clear," said John, "that Mr. Hall has
forged the note which he presented against my
uncle's estate."</p>

<p>"What a wicked man," said Mrs. Berry, "to seek
to defraud me and my poor fatherless children! I
never could have suspected him."</p>

<p>"It was the love of money, aunt. He thought you
would not detect the fraud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not but for you, John. How lucky it
was you came! Now tell me what I ought to do."</p>

<p>"Is there a lawyer in the place?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Yes; there is Mr. Bradley."</p>

<p>"Then, aunt, you had better send for him, and ask
his advice."</p>

<p>"I will do so; I think that will be the best way."</p>

<p>Mr. Bradley, though a country lawyer, was a man
of sound judgment, and quite reliable. When the
circumstances were communicated to him, he gave his
opinion that John's suspicions were well founded.</p>

<p>"I should like to see Mr. Hall here," he said.
"Can you not ask him to be present, and bring the
note with him?"</p>

<p>"The store closes at nine. I will invite him then,
if you can meet him at that hour."</p>

<p>"That will suit me, Mrs. Berry," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall was not surprised at the message he received.
He expected that the widow would be
troubled about the claim he had presented, and he
was prepared to listen to entreaties that payment
might be postponed. That his fraud was suspected
he did not dream.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hall entered the little sitting-room he
was somewhat surprised to see Mr. Bradley, the lawyer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
but it occurred to him that Mrs. Berry in her
trouble had applied to him to mediate between them.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Bradley," he said.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Hall," said the lawyer, rather
coldly.</p>

<p>"It is rather cool this evening," said Hall, trying
to appear at ease.</p>

<p>"I understand," said Mr. Bradley, not appearing
to notice this remark, "that you have a claim against
the estate of my late friend, Mr. Berry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And the amount is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two thousand dollars," said Hall, promptly.</p>

<p>"So I understood. Did you bring the note with
you?"</p>

<p>Hall opened his pocket-book, and produced the
note. The lawyer took it, and scanned it closely.</p>

<p>"Do you know what led Mr. Berry to borrow this
amount?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"He wanted to put it into his business."</p>

<p>"Did he extend his business then? He might
have done it to a considerable extent with that sum."</p>

<p>"No, I believe not," said Hall, hesitating.</p>

<p>"But I thought he borrowed the money with that
object."</p>

<p>"The truth is," said Hall, after a pause, "he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
owing parties in Boston for a considerable portion of
his stock, and it was to pay off this sum that he borrowed
the money."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are aware, Mr. Hall, that this
claim will sweep away two-thirds of Mr. Berry's
estate?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Hall, hesitating. "I didn't
know but he left more."</p>

<p>"Scarcely a thousand dollars will be left to the
family. Mrs. Berry will have a very hard time."</p>

<p>"I won't be hard upon her," said Hall. "I don't
need all the money now. I will let half of it, say,
stand for a year."</p>

<p>"But it will have to be paid finally."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I must have my money."</p>

<p>"It is rather strange that Mrs. Berry never knew
anything of this. Her husband usually told her of
his business affairs."</p>

<p>"She thought so," said Mr. Hall, significantly,</p>

<p>"Do you mean to imply that he did not?"</p>

<p>"It seems that he did not tell her of this."</p>

<p>"So it appears, and yet it is a very important
matter. By the way, Mr. Hall, it was very creditable
to a young man, like yourself, to have saved up
so considerable an amount of money. Two thousand
dollars is quite a little sum."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not save it up,&mdash;that is, not all of it," said
Hall, perceiving that this would lead to suspicion.
In fact, he was beginning to feel rather uneasy under
the lawyer's questioning.</p>

<p>"You did not save it up?"</p>

<p>"Not all of it. I received a legacy a little more
than two years since from a relative."</p>

<p>"You were fortunate. What was the amount of
the legacy?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"And you loaned all this to Mr. Berry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And five hundred dollars more."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You never mentioned this legacy at the time."</p>

<p>"Only to Mr. Berry."</p>

<p>"Where did your relative live, Mr. Hall?"</p>

<p>"In Worcester," said Hall, hesitating.</p>

<p>"What relative was it?"</p>

<p>"My aunt," answered Hall, beginning to feel
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"What was her name?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why you ask so many questions, Mr.
Bradley," said Hall, beginning to find this catechising
embarrassing, especially as he had to make up
the answers on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely you have no objection to answer my question,
Mr. Hall?" said the lawyer, looking fixedly at
the young man, who changed color.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," said Hall; "but it seems unnecessary."</p>

<p>"You must consider, Mr. Hall, that this claim is
a very unexpected one. Mr. Berry never mentioned
to any one, so far as I know, that he had borrowed
this money of you. Remember, also, that it will reduce
Mrs. Berry to poverty, and you will not be surprised
that we want to know all the particulars
respecting the transaction."</p>

<p>"I should think the note ought to be sufficient,"
said Hall.</p>

<p>"True, the note. Let me examine it once more."
The lawyer scrutinized the note, and, raising his
eyes, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This note is in Mr. Berry's handwriting, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Hall, the interest has been paid
on this note at regular intervals."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," said Hall.</p>

<p>"How often?"</p>

<p>"Every six months," he answered, more boldly.</p>

<p>"Ah, then I suppose we shall find corresponding
entries on Mr. Berry's books."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Hall; but he began to feel
very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"So that no interest is due now."</p>

<p>"About a month's interest; but never mind about
that, I won't say anything about that," said Hall,
magnanimously.</p>

<p>"You are very considerate, Mr. Hall," said the
lawyer; "but I am sure Mrs. Berry will not accept
this favor. She intends to pay you every penny she
owes you."</p>

<p>Mr. Hall brightened up at this intimation. He
thought it looked encouraging.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be hard," he said. "I don't
care for the trifle of interest due."</p>

<p>"I repeat that Mrs. Berry means to pay every
penny that is justly due, <i>but not one cent that is not so
due</i>," said the lawyer, emphasizing the last words.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the clerk, nervously; "but why
do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to tell you, Mr. Hall?" asked
Mr. Bradley, fixing his keen glance upon the young
man.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you. Because I believe this note
which I hold in my hand <i>to be a base forgery</i>."</p>

<p>Hall jumped to his feet in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me?" he asked, with
quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Hall. It is best that this matter
should be settled at once. I have made a charge,
and it is only fair that I should substantiate it, or
try to do so. Did you ever see this sheet of paper?"</p>

<p>So saying, he produced the crumpled half sheet
which John found in the stove.</p>

<p>Mr. Hall turned pale.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he faltered; but
there was a look upon his face which belied his
words.</p>

<p>"I think you <i>do</i> know, Mr. Hall," said the lawyer.
"You must be aware that forgery is a serious
matter."</p>

<p>"Give me back the note," said Hall.</p>

<p>"Do you admit it to be a forgery?"</p>

<p>"I admit nothing."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hall, I will hand you the note," said the
lawyer, after a slight pause, "merely reminding you
that, if it is what I suppose, the sooner you destroy it
the better."</p>

<p>Hall took the note with nervous haste, and thrust
it into the flame of the lamp. In an instant it was
consumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have done wisely, Mr. Hall," said Mr.
Bradley. "I have no further business with you."</p>

<p>"I shall leave Wilton to-morrow, Mrs. Berry," said
Hall. "I must ask you to get somebody else in my
place."</p>

<p>"I will pay you to-night whatever wages are due
you" said the lawyer, "in behalf of Mrs. Berry."</p>

<p>"But how shall I manage about the store?" asked
Mrs. Berry.</p>

<p>"I will take charge of it, aunt," said John,
promptly, "if you will get some one to assist me."</p>

<p>"Very well, John; but I am afraid it will be too
much for you."</p>

<p>"Never fear, aunt; I haven't been in the store
long, but I've learned a good deal about the business."</p>

<p>Hall was paid, and that was the last that was seen
of him. He went away in the stage the next morning,
and it is to be hoped that he has found out that
honesty is the best policy.</p>

<p>After he had left the room, Mr. Bradley advanced
to Mrs. Berry, and, grasping her hand, said, cordially:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on the new and improved look
of your affairs."</p>

<p>"It has lifted a great weight from my mind," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the widow. "Now I feel sure that I shall be able to
get along, especially with John's help. He was the
first to suspect Mr. Hall of attempting to cheat me."</p>

<p>"You ought to be a lawyer, John," said Mr. Bradley.
"You have shown that you have a good head
on your shoulders."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may be one some time," said John,
smiling.</p>

<p>"If you ever do, my office is open to you. Good-night,
Mrs. Berry; we've done a good evening's
work."</p>

<p>The next day John undertook the chief management
of his aunt's store. He engaged James Sanford,
who had had some experience in another town,
to help him, and things went on smoothly for a few
weeks. At the end of that time John received an important
letter from Hampton.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> John was attending to his aunt's interests
at Wilton, important events were occurring at Hampton.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that Ben Brayton was
accustomed to spend most of his time in lounging at
the tavern, or in a billiard saloon close by. It was at
the latter place that he had the privilege of forming
an acquaintance with Arthur Winchester, a young man
from the city of New York (or so he represented).
He was dressed in the extreme of the fashion, sported
a heavy gold chain, wore a diamond ring, and carried
a jaunty cane. I cannot guarantee the genuineness
of the gold or the diamond; but there was no one in
Hampton who could distinguish them from the real
articles.</p>

<p>The appearance of Mr. Arthur Winchester created
something of a sensation among the young men of
Hampton, or at least that portion who aspired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
wear fashionable clothes. Mr. Winchester's attire
was generally regarded as "nobby" in the extreme.</p>

<p>They exhibited an elegance which the highest
efforts of the village tailor had never succeeded in
reaching. Forthwith the smart young men in Hampton
became possessed with the desire to have their
clothes made in the same faultless style, and Mr.
Winchester was accommodating enough to permit the
village tailor to take a pattern from his garments.</p>

<p>Among those who gazed with admiration at the
new-comer was Ben Brayton. He was the first,
indeed, to order a suit like Mr. Winchester's, in
which, when obtained, he strutted about proudly, arm
in arm with the young man himself.</p>

<p>Various circumstances served to strengthen the intimacy
between the two. In the first place neither
had any weighty occupations to prevent their drinking
or playing billiards together, and it chanced after
a time that this became a regular business with them.</p>

<p>Ben Brayton was an average player, and appeared
nearly equal to his new friend. At all events, in the
friendly trials of skill that took place between them,
Ben came off victorious perhaps a third of the time.</p>

<p>"Come, Ben," said Winchester, one morning, "this
is slow. Suppose we make the games a little more
exciting by staking a little on the game."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/image8.jpg" width="385" height="596" alt="" />
</div>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're a better player than I am, Winchester,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"Not much. You beat me pretty often. However,
I'll give you twenty points, and stake a dollar
on the game."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Ben. "A dollar isn't much."</p>

<p>"Agreed."</p>

<p>The game was played, and, counting the twenty
points conceded, Ben came off victorious by five
points.</p>

<p>He pocketed the dollar with a sense of elation.</p>

<p>"Will you have another?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I will. I'm bound to have my revenge."</p>

<p>The second game was played, and likewise terminated
in Ben's favor. He pocketed the second
dollar with satisfaction. He had never found billiards
so interesting.</p>

<p>"Come, Brayton, this won't do. I didn't think you
were so good a player. You'll clean me out at this
rate."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only happened to be lucky," said Ben, in
high good humor. "Shall we try it again?"</p>

<p>Of course they tried it again, and spent nearly
the entire day in the same way. Fortune veered
about a little, and Ben came out minus three dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, Brayton, you'll get it back to-morrow,"
said Winchester, as they parted.</p>

<p>So Ben thought, and the furor of gaming had
already taken such possession of him that he got up
unusually early, anxious to get at the fascinating
game.</p>

<p>So matters went on for a week. They never exceeded
one dollar as stakes, and played so even that
Ben was only ten dollars behindhand. This he paid
from his allowance, and so far from being satiated
with the game could hardly restrain his impatience
till Monday morning should give him a chance of
playing again.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that Ben had fallen
into dangerous company. Mr. Arthur Winchester
was really a far superior player, and eventually meant
to fleece Ben out of his last dollar. But he did not
wish to arouse suspicion of his intentions, and
"played off," as the saying is, and thus had no difficulty
in luring Ben on to the point at which he aimed.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week Ben was only five
dollars behind.</p>

<p>"You're gaining upon me," said Winchester.
"You're improving in your play."</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Ben, flattered.</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it. I don't like to boast, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
am considered a first-class player in the city, and, by
Jove, you're almost even with me."</p>

<p>Ben listened with gratification to this praise. He
didn't doubt that Winchester was the first-class
player he represented, and in fact he was a superior
player, but he had never yet put forth his utmost skill.
He had only played with Ben, suiting himself to his
inferior style of playing.</p>

<p>Gradually Winchester suggested higher play.</p>

<p>"A dollar is nothing," he said. "Let us make it
five."</p>

<p>Ben hesitated.</p>

<p>"That's a good deal to lose," he said.</p>

<p>"That's true, but isn't it as much to win? Come,
it will make our games more interesting, and you're
as likely to come out ahead as I am."</p>

<p>"That is true," thought Ben.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," he said; "give me twenty-five
points, and I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Anything for excitement," said Winchester;
"but we're so nearly matched that you'll beat me
twice out of three times on those odds."</p>

<p>Ben did beat the first game, and the exultation
with which he pocketed the stakes revealed to his
experienced opponent that he had the game in his
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the afternoon Ben stood
one game ahead. He was flushed and excited by his
success.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Winchester; "let's give
up child's play and have the real thing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Let us stake fifty dollars, and done with it.
That'll be something worth playing for."</p>

<p>Ben started in surprise. The magnitude of the
stake took his breath away.</p>

<p>"I haven't got the money," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you can give me your note. I'll wait,
that is, of course if I win; but I am not so sure of
that as I was. You're a pretty smart player."</p>

<p>Ben did not hesitate long. He was dazzled by the
idea of winning fifty dollars, and his success thus far
encouraged him to think that he would.</p>

<p>"Give me thirty points, then," he said.</p>

<p>"I ought not to; but anything for excitement."</p>

<p>The game was commenced. Ben led till towards
the close of the game, when his opponent improved
his play, and came out three points ahead.</p>

<p>"It was a close shave," he said.</p>

<p>Ben looked uneasy. It was all very agreeable to
win a large sum; but to lose was not so comfortable.</p>

<p>"I haven't got the money," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, give me your note, and pay when it's convenient!
In fact, perhaps you need not pay at all.
You may win the next game."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I had better play," said Ben,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't leave off a loser. You must have
your revenge. In fact, I'll make you a good offer.
We'll play for a hundred dollars, and I'll give you
thirty-five points. That'll square us up, and make
me your debtor."</p>

<p>"Say forty, and I'll agree."</p>

<p>"Forty let it be then; but you'll win."</p>

<p>Again Winchester permitted Ben to gain in the
commencement of the game, but towards the last he
took care to make up for lost time by a brilliant play
that brought him out victor.</p>

<p>"I was lucky," he said. "I began to think, the
first part of the game, that all was over with me."</p>

<p>Ben, silly dupe that he was, did not fathom the
rascality of his companion.</p>

<p>"I don't think I played as well as usual," he said,
ruefully.</p>

<p>"No, you didn't. Perhaps your hand has got a
little out, you have played so many hours on a
stretch."</p>

<p>Ben gave Winchester another due-bill for one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
dollars, wondering how he should be able to meet
it. He was rather frightened, and resolved not to
play the next day. But when the next day came his
resolution evaporated. I need not describe the wiles
used by Arthur Winchester. It is enough that at the
close of the coming day he held notes signed by Ben
for three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>He assured the disturbed Ben that he needn't
trouble himself about the matter; that he didn't
need the money just yet. He would give him time to
pay it in, and other things to the same effect. But
having come to the conclusion that Ben had been bled
as much as he could stand, he called him aside the
next morning, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, my dear Brayton, but
I've just had a letter recalling me to the city. Could
you let me have that money as well as not, say this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon!" exclaimed Ben, in dismay. "I
don't see how I can get it at all."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to repudiate your debts of honor?"
said Winchester, sternly.</p>

<p>"No," said Ben, faltering; "but I've got no
money."</p>

<p>"You ought to have made sure of that," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Winchester, shortly, "before playing with a gentleman.
Go to your mother. She is rich."</p>

<p>"She won't give me the money."</p>

<p>"Look here, Brayton," said Winchester, "I must
have that money. I don't care how you get it. But
some way or other it must be got. I hope you
understand."</p>

<p>A bright idea came to Ben.</p>

<p>"You can't collect my notes," he said; "I'm
under age."</p>

<p>"Then," said Winchester, his face darkening with
a frown that made Ben shiver, "I demand satisfaction.
To-morrow morning, at five o'clock, I will meet
you with swords or pistols, as you prefer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Ben, his teeth chattering,
for he was an arrant coward.</p>

<p>"What I say! If the law will not give me satisfaction,
I will demand the satisfaction of a gentleman.
Fight or pay, take your choice; but one or the
other you must do."</p>

<p>The sentence closed with an oath.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," said Ben, terrified. "Of course
I mean to pay you."</p>

<p>"Then you'll let me have the money to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I'll try."</p>

<p>The two parted, and Ben, thoroughly miserable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
went home, trying to devise some means to appease
his inexorable creditor, whom he began to wish he
had never met.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">BEN MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> went home slowly, in a state of great perplexity.
He knew his mother too well to think she would
pay him three hundred dollars without weighty cause.
Should he tell her the scrape he had got into? He
felt a natural reluctance to do that, nor was he by
any means satisfied that she would pay the money if
he did. Then again he was ashamed to admit that
he was afraid to fight. He felt convinced that,
should he reveal the matter, his mother would bid him
take advantage of the legal worthlessness of his notes
to Winchester. He would gladly do it, but was
afraid, and did not dare to admit it. On the whole,
Ben felt decidedly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Is mother at home?" he inquired, when he
reached home.</p>

<p>"No; she's gone over to Mrs. Talbot's to spend
the afternoon," was the reply.</p>

<p>Ben felt relieved by this assurance, though he
hardly knew why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder whether mother has got as much as
three hundred dollars by her," he thought.</p>

<p>With this thought in his mind he went upstairs,
and entered his mother's chamber.</p>

<p>The first thing he caught sight of when he entered
was a little bunch of keys lying on the table. He
knew at once that they were his mother's keys. It
was certainly extraordinary that she should on that
particular day have left them exposed. She was
generally very careful. But it chanced that she had
hurried away, and in her haste had forgotten the keys,
nor did she think of them while absent.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances Ben would have
made no improper use of the keys thus thrown in his
way; but, harassed as he was by the importunities
of Winchester, it seemed to him a stroke of luck that
placed them in his power.</p>

<p>He determined to open the drawers of his mother's
bureau, and see what he could find. If only he
could find the sum he wanted he could get out of his
present difficulties, and perhaps explain it to his
mother afterwards.</p>

<p>Ben, after several trials, succeeded in finding the
key that fitted the upper drawer. He examined the
contents eagerly. It was of course filled with a
variety of articles of apparel, but in one corner Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
found a portemonnaie. He opened it, and discovered
a roll of bills, six in number, each of the denomination
of twenty dollars.</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty dollars!" he said.
"That's more than a third of the bill. Perhaps, if I
pay that, Winchester'll wait for the rest."</p>

<p>It occurred to him, however, that a further search
might reveal some more money. If he could get
thirty dollars more, for example, that with the other
would make one half the sum he owed Winchester,
and with that surely the other might be content, for
the present at least. The rest of the debt he could
arrange to pay out of his weekly allowance, say at
the rate of five dollars a week.</p>

<p>Accordingly Ben began to poke about until he
found a folded paper. He opened it with curiosity
and began to read. His interest deepened, and his
excitement increased.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he said, "if this isn't the lost will I've
heard so much talk about. The old lady's kept it
mighty quiet. Wouldn't John Oakley give something
to get hold of it?"</p>

<p>Ben sat down to reflect upon the discovery he had
made.</p>

<p>"Mother's right to keep it quiet," he said to himself.
"She ought to have destroyed it, and I verily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
believe she has tried," he continued, as he noticed
the scorched appearance of the will. "I wonder she
didn't."</p>

<p>The next question to consider was, what to do with
it. It did not take long to decide. His mother
would be very much frightened, and this would give
him a hold upon her, by which he might induce her
to give him the money he required.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll keep it," he said.</p>

<p>He put the roll of bills into his pocket-book, carefully
deposited the will in his side-pocket, and, shutting
and locking the bureau-drawer, placed the keys
in the same position upon the table in which he had
found them, and then left the room.</p>

<p>"A pretty good day's work!" thought Ben to himself.
"I think I'll go and pay Winchester what
money I have, and get him to wait a few days for the
rest."</p>

<p>Ben left the house, and wended his way to the tavern.
He found Winchester in the bar-room, smoking
a cigar. He looked up inquiringly as Ben entered.</p>

<p>"How are you, Winchester?" said Ben.</p>

<p>"All right," said the latter, noticing Ben's changed
demeanor, and auguring favorably from it. "Have
a cigar?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do," said Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Winchester handed him one, and the two sat down
together.</p>

<p>"Oh, about that money," said Ben, after a little
pause. "I can let you have a part of it now, but I
shall have to make you wait a few days for the rest."</p>

<p>"How much can you pay me now?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty dollars," said Ben.</p>

<p>"That's good," said Winchester, with satisfaction.
"The fact is, I'm deuced hard up, and need it."</p>

<p>"I don't want to pay you here," said Ben.
"Come out a little way, and I'll hand it to you."</p>

<p>"All right. I'd like a walk."</p>

<p>The two sauntered forth together, and Ben paid
over the money.</p>

<p>"You'll oblige me by not mentioning to anybody
that I have paid you any money," said Ben. "I
have a reason for it."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you the reason."</p>

<p>"That's your affair."</p>

<p>"Now about the rest."</p>

<p>"Yes, about the rest."</p>

<p>"I think I can get it for you in a few days."</p>

<p>"I can wait a few days to oblige you, but I must
go to the city as soon as I can get away. So please
hurry up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can. This morning," he added,
"I didn't see how I was going to get the money.
My mother wouldn't look upon it as we do, as a debt
of honor; but since then I've been lucky enough to
get possession of one of her secrets, and I think it
will help me."</p>

<p>"Glad of it," said Winchester, "for your sake. I
don't care, of course, how you get the money, as
long as you do get it. That's the main thing, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"Now what do you say to another little game of
billiards?"</p>

<p>"I can't stake any more money. I've lost enough,"
said Ben, sensibly.</p>

<p>"Then let it be a friendly game&mdash;just a little
trial of skill, that's all."</p>

<p>To this Ben was not averse, and the two made
their way as so often before to the billiard saloon.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mrs. Oakley returned home from
her afternoon visit. She had not yet missed her
keys, but on going up to her chamber, discovered
them lying upon the table.</p>

<p>"How terribly careless I have been!" she said.
"I hope they have not been seen."</p>

<p>Tolerably sure of this, she opened the upper bureau-drawer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and looked for the portemonnaie. It was in
the same place. She opened it, and found it empty.
Her eyes flashed with indignation.</p>

<p>"Some one has been to the drawer," she said.</p>

<p>She next thought of the will, and felt for it. <i>It
was not there!</i> She turned pale, and with nervous
fingers took everything out of the drawer, hoping to
find it misplaced. But her search was vain. The
will was not to be found.</p>

<p>She sank back into a chair, and exclaimed with
passionate regret:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fool that I was! Why did I not make all sure
by burning it?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>



<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">MRS. OAKLEY'S SUSPICIONS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sudden disappearance of the will struck Mrs.
Oakley with dismay. It threatened her with the loss
of two-thirds of her estate. But she was not a
woman to bear it in silence. She possessed a fund
of energy, and lost no time in seeking to determine
the important question, "Who had taken it?"</p>

<p>She descended at once to the kitchen, where she
found Hannah setting the table for supper.</p>

<p>"Hannah," she said, abruptly, "have you been
upstairs to my chamber this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Hannah.</p>

<p>"Think a moment," said her mistress, sternly;
"have you not been up?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I haven't. I told you so once," said
Hannah, not altogether pleased with the doubt implied
by the second question.</p>

<p>"Has any one called here since I went away?"
asked Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Then there has been no one in the house excepting
yourself?"</p>

<p>"No one except Master Ben."</p>

<p>"Ben!" repeated Mrs. Oakley, in a changed
voice. "When did Ben come home?"</p>

<p>"About an hour ago,&mdash;maybe an hour and a half,"
said Hannah.</p>

<p>"He is not here now."</p>

<p>"Isn't he, ma'am? I suppose he went out, but I
didn't hear him."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure no one else has been in the
house?" inquired her mistress.</p>

<p>"Certain sure, ma'am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley went upstairs slowly. A new idea
had forced its way into her mind. It must be that
Ben had taken both the money and the will. That
he should have taken the first didn't surprise her, for
with all her love for her son, she had small confidence
in his honesty. No doubt he had got into debt, and
so was tempted to appropriate the bills. But why
should he have taken the will? That was something
she could not understand. For the money she cared
little comparatively. But the loss of the will was
ruin, if John or his friends found it, or, if not, she
would live in perpetual fear of their discovering it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I once get hold of it again," she said to herself,
"I will take care that all danger from that
source shall end and forever. Ben will never divulge
its existence, of course. He will understand that it
affects his interests too nearly."</p>

<p>She waited in nervous excitement for Ben's reappearance.</p>

<p>At length his step was heard&mdash;never more welcome
than now.</p>

<p>Ben entered, feeling rather nervous also.</p>

<p>"Has mother found out?" he thought.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, mother," he said, with apparent
unconcern. "Is supper most ready? I'm awful
hungry."</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you a moment, Benjamin,"
said his mother. "Will you come upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Now for it," thought Ben.</p>

<p>"Can't you speak here just as well?" he said.
"I'm tired."</p>

<p>"I would rather have you come upstairs," said
Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Just as you say," said Ben; "but I don't see why
you can't talk just as well down here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley led the way to her own chamber.
Ben followed, feeling, it must be confessed, not altogether
comfortable. This feeling was not diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
when his mother closed the door carefully. She
turned and confronted him.</p>

<p>"You have been to my bureau-drawer, Ben," she
said, eying him fixedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Ben.</p>

<p>"You came home about two hours ago, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I came home then," said Ben, knowing that
it would be of no use to deny what could be proved
by Hannah's testimony.</p>

<p>"You came up to this chamber, found my keys on
the table, and opened the upper drawer of my
bureau."</p>

<p>"Did you see me do it?" asked Ben, feeling confident
that he was accused on suspicion merely.</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doesn't Hannah pretend that she saw me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Lucky for her she doesn't. If she did she'd lie,"
said Ben, glad to find out so much.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to deny that you came up here?"
asked Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. It seems to me you're mighty quick
in suspecting me," continued Ben, with an air of injured
innocence. "But what's all the fuss about?
Have you missed anything?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said his mother, "I have met with a serious
loss. But, Benjamin, it is very important that I
should clearly understand who did or did not take it.
Will you assure me upon your honor that you did
not take anything from my bureau?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will," said Ben, who felt that he was
in for it, and must stick stoutly to the lie at all hazards.
"But you haven't told me what you lost."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley turned pale with consternation. She
had depended upon Ben's proving the real culprit, in
which case she could require restitution, at any rate,
of the will.</p>

<p>"I lost a sum of money," she said,&mdash;"a hundred
and twenty dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Ben. "That <i>was</i> a loss."</p>

<p>"But that was not all. There was besides a&mdash;a
document of importance, for which I cared more than
the money."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt of it," thought Ben.</p>

<p>"What was it?" he said aloud.</p>

<p>"What it was is quite immaterial," said Mrs.
Oakley. "It is sufficient to say that it was a document
of very great importance. I care little for the
money compared with that. If you took it, Ben," she
said, with a sudden final appeal, "I will forgive you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and let you keep the money, if you will restore the&mdash;the
document."</p>

<p>There was a look of entreaty in the proud woman's
eyes, as she made this appeal to her son. She
waited anxiously for the answer.</p>

<p>But the inducement was not sufficient. The one
hundred and twenty dollars were already paid away,
and Ben owed one hundred and eighty dollars besides.
He knew that Winchester would not remit
the debt. There was no chance whatever of that.
So Ben determined to keep the <i>rle</i> of injured innocence
which he had assumed in the beginning. His
mother would not be able to find him out. It may
be thought that this was inconsistent with his plan
of raising money out of his mother's fears by withholding
the will. But he had arranged that already.
<i>He might find the will</i>,&mdash;perhaps in Hannah's chamber,
perhaps elsewhere, he could decide that hereafter;
but he resolved not to own up to the theft. In
fact, after denying it stoutly, it would have been difficult
to do that.</p>

<p>"Look here, mother," he said, "I am not a thief,
and I wish you would not try to make me out one.
You're ready enough to suspect me. Why don't you
suspect Hannah? She was here all the time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have already spoken to Hannah," said Mrs.
Oakley.</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said she had not been upstairs during my
absence."</p>

<p>"And you believed her," said Ben, reproachfully.
"Do you believe her before me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believed her," said Mrs. Oakley; "and I
will tell you why. She might take the money, but
she wouldn't be likely to take the paper."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. She might think it was
of importance. She might think you would pay her
money to get it back."</p>

<p>Just then it flashed across Mrs. Oakley's mind that
Hannah had seen the will in her hand on the day that
she undertook to burn it. Why had she not thought
of that before? It might be that Hannah was more
artful than she gave her credit for, and, suspecting the
value of the document, had taken it as well as the
money.</p>

<p>"I will question Hannah again," she said. "Come
with me, Benjamin."</p>

<p>They went downstairs together, and Hannah was
summoned from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hannah," said Mrs. Oakley, "listen attentively
to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, ma'am," said Hannah, wondering what
was coming.</p>

<p>"Something was taken from my drawer this afternoon,
Hannah,&mdash;some money and something else.
Do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Sure I don't, ma'am. I told you once before."</p>

<p>"If you took it, and will tell me, and restore everything,
I will forgive you, and let you keep ten dollars
of the money besides."</p>

<p>"But I didn't take it, ma'am," said poor Hannah,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"If you don't," said Mrs. Oakley, sternly, "I will
send for the constable, and have you arrested at once
and carried to prison."</p>

<p>Hannah burst into a piteous howl, and declared
that she never stole so much as a pin, and called the
Virgin and all the saints to witness that she was innocent.</p>

<p>"Give up the paper you took," said Mrs. Oakley,
"and you may keep twenty dollars of the money."</p>

<p>But Hannah again declared that she took nothing.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," said Ben; "maybe we're all
wrong. When I went out of the house I saw a very
suspicious-looking man coming this way."</p>

<p>"What was his appearance?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had black hair and whiskers," said Ben, glibly,
"and was meanly dressed."</p>

<p>"Was he coming towards the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did such a person come to the house, Hannah?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him; but he might have come to the
wing door without me knowing it."</p>

<p>"I'll bet ten dollars he was the thief," said Ben.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley did not know what to say or think.
Both Ben and Hannah stoutly denied the theft, and
resisted the most liberal overtures to a confession.
It might be the ill-looking man spoken of.</p>

<p>"What'll you give me if I find the paper, mother?"
asked Ben. "I'll get on the track of the scamp, and
get it if I can."</p>

<p>"I'll give fifty dollars," said his mother.</p>

<p>"But you offered a hundred a little while ago."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a hundred and twenty then."</p>

<p>"Promise me two hundred cash down, and I'll do
my best."</p>

<p>"I'll give you two hundred dollars when you place
the paper in my hands."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ben. "If I can find the man,
I'll offer him a little something to begin with. It
won't be of any use to him, you know."</p>

<p>They sat down to supper. Ben partook heartily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
feeling that he had as good as got the two hundred
dollars, while Mrs. Oakley was pale and nervous, and
had no appetite. How differently she would have
felt if she had only known that the lost will was all
the while laid snugly away in Ben's coat-pocket!</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">A STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> decided not to produce the will too soon. It
would look suspicious. Besides, the longer it remained
missing, the more rejoiced his mother would
be to recover it, and so naturally the more ready to
pay the reward she had promised. The afternoon of
the next day he thought would be quite soon enough
to "find" it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the next morning Ben strolled over to
the tavern, thinking he might find Winchester. But
that young man had gone out on a fishing excursion,
and had left word to that effect with the landlord.</p>

<p>So Ben strolled down to the river. It was a delightful
day, and the desire seized him to "go in
swimming." Though he cared little for other athletic
exercises, he was fond of swimming, and was quite a
fair swimmer.</p>

<p>Now, as Ben's ill luck would have it, Sam Selwyn
chanced to be in the woods quite near by, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Ben undress and go into the water. He was not
fond of Ben, and he was fond of a practical joke.
Besides, he had been for some time wanting to pay
off Ben for the share he had in making John's life
uncomfortable. A plan suggested itself to him.</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" he exclaimed, his eyes twinkling with
merriment.</p>

<p>He ran home,&mdash;it was but a few steps across lots,&mdash;dashed
upstairs, and from an upper room took
a faded calico dress and hoop-skirt, and, rolling them
up, made his way swiftly back to the river. The
river's edge was heavily wooded, and running vines
and thick underbrush almost completely concealed
the water from the sight. He went to the place
where Ben had deposited his clothes, took away
his coat, vest, and pantaloons, put the gown and
hoop-skirt in their place, and quickly departed.
Ben's clothes he hid away in the hollow trunk
of an old tree not more than two rods distant.
But in doing so a folded paper slipped out of the
coat-pocket. Sam's attention was drawn towards it,
for it looked like the legal papers of which his father
had so many in his office. Opening it under an impulse
of curiosity, his face instantly glowed with an
expression of the most earnest and enthusiastic joy.</p>

<p>"By all my lucky stars!" he exclaimed; "if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
isn't the lost will! This will set John all right. I
wonder how that scamp got hold of it!"</p>

<p>Sam put the will in his own inside coat-pocket, and
buttoned up his coat to make sure that it was safe.
He wanted to go at once and communicate the joyful
discovery to his father, but he also wanted to enjoy
Ben's dismay when he found his clothes gone. This
he could not forego on any account, and that he
might be an unseen witness of all that occurred, he
climbed up a large tree whose thick-leaved branches
hid him completely.</p>

<p>Hardly had he concealed himself before Ben
emerged from the water. He at once proceeded to
the spot where he had left his clothing. In ludicrous
perplexity he gazed at the remarkable change which
had taken place. He lifted the gown and skirt, and
found that his shirt, collar, hat, stockings, and shoes
were untouched.</p>

<p>He put on his shirt and stockings, and called out,
angrily, thinking the author of the trick might be
within hearing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, bring back my clothes!"</p>

<p>But no reply was made.</p>

<p>"Bring back my clothes, I say!" he called, in
louder and more angry accents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>But again this reasonable request fell unheeded.
He waited anxiously for a response, but none came.</p>

<p>"Where are you, you scoundrel?" he screamed, in
very ill temper.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you knew?" thought Sam, as he
looked calmly down from a distance upon Ben.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the scamp has hid my clothes somewhere
about here," thought Ben.</p>

<p>He proceeded to search in every direction he could
think of. But the hollow tree, rather strangely, did
not occur to him and escaped his notice.</p>

<p>His anger and dismay increased as he found his
search vain.</p>

<p>"I wish I had the mean, contemptible rascal here!"
he exclaimed. "I'd break every bone in his body!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Ben Brayton," silently
commented Sam, from his secure post of observation.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" thought Ben, gloomily.</p>

<p>He sat down to consider. His situation was certainly
an embarrassing one. Of course he could not
go home in his shirt, and the only alternative was to
wear the odious gown. It was hard to make up his
mind to that. He preferred to wait awhile to see if
help would not come from some quarter. Sam began
to get tired in his perch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't the fellow dress and go home?" he
muttered.</p>

<p>At length Ben made up his mind that it must be
done, and, with a hearty anathema on the author of
his perplexity, robed himself in the dress. Sam nearly
exploded with laughter as he saw Ben arrayed in the
gown, which fell lank around him. Ben gazed ruefully
at his extraordinary figure, and then at the hoop-skirt.
He concluded that he would not look quite so badly
with that addition. He therefore fitted it on as well
as he could, and adjusted his dress by the help of
some pins which he found sticking in the dress.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a hood or something to hide my
face," muttered Ben, dismally. "I might pass for a
girl then. Now folks will stare at me as if I was mad,
and if any one sees me I shall never hear the last of
it."</p>

<p>Certainly Ben's black felt hat did not look much in
keeping with the faded calico dress, now properly
filled out by the hoop-skirt, which swayed from side to
side as he walked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's too rich!" thought Sam, almost choking
with suppressed laughter. "What a sensation he
will make in the village!"</p>

<p>Just then Ben's foot got caught somehow, and
he fell sprawling. He gathered himself up with furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
energy, and did not observe that there was a
conspicuous stain of mud on his dress. He took a
roundabout way, so as to remain under cover of the
woods as long as he could.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"I must meet Ben, and enjoy his discomfort,"
thought Sam.</p>

<p>He scrambled down from the tree, and cautiously
made a short cut for the road, unseen by Ben. He
posted himself at a place where Ben must emerge.
He walked along, apparently absorbed in thought,
till he came face to face with Ben, who, very much
ashamed of his appearance, was walking as fast as his
embarrassing clothing would allow.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Ben Brayton!" he exclaimed, in
affected amazement. "Why, what possesses you to
go round in this style?"</p>

<p>"No choice of mine. I couldn't help it," said Ben,
ruefully. "I went in swimming. Some scamp stole
my clothes, and left these traps in their place."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, Ben, really you do cut the
queerest figure I ever saw!" said Sam, giving vent
to his pent-up mirth.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to laugh at," said Ben,
in a most aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>"You would if you could only see yourself," said
Sam,&mdash;and he burst out with laughter again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me?" said Ben, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Ben; but really I can't help it. See,
there's Miss Clark coming. If she don't laugh I'll
forfeit a dollar."</p>

<p>Miss Clark was one of the prettiest young ladies in
the village, and to be seen by her was most humiliating.
But there was no dodging it. She met Ben
face to face, and, as might be expected, was moved to
merriment.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Miss Clark," said Ben, sheepishly.</p>

<p>The young lady tried to say good-morning, but
only burst into a fresh fit of mirth as she passed
along, Sam joining her a few moments afterwards.</p>

<p>Ben walked on very much discomposed. He was
still half a mile from home, and it was very probable
that he would meet others.</p>

<p>"I'd give fifty dollars to be safe at home," he
groaned.</p>

<p>He had reason to say so. Just then the scholars
in the village school were sent out to their morning
recess. They espied the strange figure, and instantly,
boy-like, started in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Keep your distance!" said Ben, furiously, to his
young tormentors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh my! what a fine young lady I am!" said one.</p>

<p>"How <i>do you do</i> this morning, <i>Miss</i> Brayton?"
said another.</p>

<p>"What a <i>becoming</i> dress!" commented another,
with much admiration.</p>

<p>Ben tried to give chase to his tormentors, but, as
might have been expected, not being accustomed to
his attire, tripped, and fell headlong.</p>

<p>Then a shout, long and loud, went up from the
boys.</p>

<p>Ben could not stand it. He gathered up his skirts,
and ran towards home with all the expedition he was
capable of. The old doctor met him, and gazed in
wonder at the flying figure, not recognizing Ben in his
new costume. He began to speculate whether it
might not be an insane person, who had broken from
his or her confinement.</p>

<p>Panting for breath, Ben at length brought up at
his own door. It was locked, Mrs. Oakley having followed
the old adage of "shutting the stable-door
after the horse is stolen." Ben rang a tremendous
peal at the door-bell, which was quickly answered by
Hannah.</p>

<p>When she saw the strange figure before her, she
uttered a loud shriek, and fled with precipitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley heard the bell and Hannah's shriek,
and came hastily to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"What does this ridiculous masquerading mean?"
she demanded, sternly.</p>

<p>"It means that I went in swimming, and some
rascal stole my clothes and left these," growled Ben,
provoked that he should be blamed for his misfortune.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, flashed upon Ben the
crowning misfortune,&mdash;that the lost will was in his
coat-pocket. Upon the recovery of that depended
his chance of getting the two hundred dollars. He
sank into a chair, pale with dismay.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, Ben?" asked his mother, hastily.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "but I must dress as quick as possible,
and go back and find my clothes if I can."</p>

<p>He dressed in nervous haste, and set out for the
woods. This time he espied the hollow tree. There
he found his clothes. He felt in the pockets, and
found that everything was safe, including his watch
and pocket-book.</p>

<p>But the will was gone! Ben instituted a strict
and careful search in every conceivable direction, but
he found no trace of the lost document.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A letter</span> was at once despatched to John, from
Squire Selwyn, requesting his immediate return to
Hampton.</p>

<p>Though no reason was assigned for the summons,
John of course lost no time in obeying it. On the
third day he was set down at the lawyer's house.</p>

<p>"O John, how glad I am to see you!" said Sam,
in his delight flinging both arms around John's neck,
and giving him a warm embrace.</p>

<p>John's greeting was no less hearty.</p>

<p>"Such news, John!" said Sam.</p>

<p>"It isn't the will?" inquired John, eagerly.</p>

<p>"But it is, though."</p>

<p>"Found?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I found it. Didn't I tell you so!
Don't you remember my dream?"</p>

<p>"But perhaps it's all a dream now."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is, it's a substantial dream, and father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
got the document locked up in his safe. You're no
longer dependent on Mrs. Oakley, and you can go to
college with me, and&mdash;you don't know how glad I
am."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Sam," said John. "You're just as
glad as if it had happened to yourself, and that's
what I expected of you. But you haven't told me
how it was found yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was such fun!" said Sam. "Sit down
here, and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that John was amused by
the story of Ben's ludicrous embarrassment; but he
was surprised as well.</p>

<p>"How could Ben have got hold of it? I don't
understand that."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Sam. "But as long as we've got
it, we won't trouble ourselves about that."</p>

<p>It was decided that the next morning Squire Selwyn,
accompanied by John, should call on Mrs. Oakley,
and make arrangements founded on the new
phase of affairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley had not received intelligence of
John's return, and her surprise was accompanied by
a nervous sensation, when Hannah came up to her
chamber, and announced that Squire Selwyn was
below, and Master John was with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"John Oakley?" she demanded, hastily.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley entered the parlor with her old
haughty step, and coldly bade the lawyer "good-morning."
Of John she took no notice.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Oakley," said John.</p>

<p>"So you have got back, have you?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has got home to stay," said Squire Selwyn,
significantly.</p>

<p>"With or without my permission, I suppose," said
Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I don't know that he needs anybody's permission
to live in his own house," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"His own house!" repeated Mrs. Oakley, in a
voice which, despite her efforts, betrayed some nervousness.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Oakley. My object in calling upon
you this morning is to apprise you that the will is
found."</p>

<p>"What will?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Your late husband's last will and testament, in
which he bequeaths this estate to his son John, here
present."</p>

<p>"Where's the will?"</p>

<p>"Here," said the lawyer, producing it.</p>

<p>"Will you let me see it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excuse me, but it must remain in my possession
till it is publicly read."</p>

<p>"What reason have I for believing this to be a
genuine document?" said Mrs. Oakley, harshly. It
was foolish thus to contend, and she knew it; but it
angered her that by the document she should be
stripped of two-thirds of what she had come to look
upon as her own.</p>

<p>"I am prepared to swear that it is the will which I
drew up for your husband three months before his
death."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am not to ask how it came into your
possession?" said Mrs. Oakley. "If it was concealed
in this house, some one must have entered illegally,
and made a secret search."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley fixed her eyes upon John, feeling
satisfied that he had entered the house on the day
she left her keys out, and opened the drawer.</p>

<p>"If you think I had anything to do with it, Mrs.
Oakley," said John, "you are mistaken. I only
reached Hampton last evening, summoned by Squire
Selwyn."</p>

<p>"I accused you of nothing," said Mrs. Oakley, but
she was greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"As to who found the will, Mrs. Oakley," said
Squire Selwyn, composedly, "I will only suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
that your son Benjamin can probably throw more
light on this matter than any one else."</p>

<p>"Benjamin!" exclaimed Mrs. Oakley, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have reason to think he can give you all
the information you desire."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oakley compressed her lips closely. Was it
possible that Ben had found the will and deliberately
carried it to Squire Selwyn? Could he have sold her
and his own interests to the enemy? No doubt she
argued, Squire Selwyn had bribed him at a heavy
price to deliver it up.</p>

<p>"I don't understand this," she said. "If Benjamin
found the will, he should have brought it to
me."</p>

<p>"As, of course, you would have placed it in my
hands, there is no harm done," said the lawyer,
watching keenly the face that showed some discomposure
as he spoke. "But you can settle that with
Ben. I will merely read you the provisions of the
will informally, previous to presenting it for probate."</p>

<p>To this Mrs. Oakley could make no objection,
though she was fully acquainted with the document
to be read.</p>

<p>It provided that the home estate, consisting of the
family mansion, and lands situated in the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Hampton, valued together at twenty thousand dollars,
should go to John. Of the remaining estate, invested
in stocks and bonds, valued at forty thousand
dollars, one half was to go to John, and the remaining
half to Mrs. Oakley. Squire Selwyn was appointed
executor, and guardian of John, until the
latter should attain his majority.</p>

<p>"If the will is genuine,"&mdash;commenced Mrs. Oakley,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You certainly do not question my word to that
effect?" said the lawyer, gravely.</p>

<p>"I have no right to stay in this house," continued
Mrs. Oakley.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure John would wish you to exercise
your own choice in that matter."</p>

<p>"I shall not remain a tenant on sufferance," said
Mrs. Oakley, coldly. "Next week Benjamin and I
go to the city."</p>

<p>"You will act your own pleasure, of course,"
said Squire Selwyn, rather glad to hear it, if the
truth must be told.</p>

<p>Some other matters were discussed and they rose
to go. John received no invitation to remain.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must burden your hospitality,
Squire Selwyn," he said, as they left the house.</p>

<p>"You are a welcome guest, and will always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
be, John," said the lawyer. "Sam will be delighted
at the arrangement."</p>

<p>"I don't know how my aunt will manage without
me," said John. "I was her business manager."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, John, that your aunt had better
sell out her store, and come and keep house for you.
You will have a large house, and you are not quite
old enough to marry and go to house-keeping."</p>

<p>"Not quite," said John, laughing.</p>

<p>"Your aunt will thus be relieved from business
anxieties, and you are quite rich enough to provide
for her and your cousins."</p>

<p>"It is an excellent arrangement," said John.
"I'll write to her at once."</p>

<p>John did write, and, as might have been expected
his aunt was very glad to accept his offer. It was,
of course, impossible to doubt the validity of the
will, and its provisions were, as soon as practicable,
carried into effect. Mrs. Oakley removed to New
York with Ben, and established herself at a boarding-house.
On some accounts it was an unwise step.
Ben, having nothing useful to do, grew dissipated,
and contracted debts on all hands. In five years his
mother's twenty thousand dollars had dwindled to a
few hundreds, and once more she found herself
obliged to exert herself for a support. She opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
a boarding-house, by means of which she managed
to make a living. As for Ben, who she fondly hoped
would grow up a gentleman, he appears to be sinking
deeper and deeper every day into worthlessness and
dissipation. He has cost his mother many sorrowful
hours.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxter is dead. Probably his excesses
in drinking hastened his death. His poor wife was
left quite destitute. When John heard of her distress,
grateful for her sympathy at a time when he
stood in need of it, he asked permission to help her.
A certain sum is paid her annually by him, by
which, with her earnings as a dress-maker,&mdash;a trade
which she followed before her marriage,&mdash;she is able
to make a comfortable living for herself and her children.</p>

<p>John returned to his studies, and was admitted to
college with Sam, where both took a high rank.
They graduated at the last commencement, and are
now both studying law.</p>

<p>Squire Bradley, of Wilton, who was much impressed
by the skill with which John ferreted out
Mr. Hall's rascality, is anxious to have John enter
his office; but Sam, who is unwilling to part with one
who from boyhood has been his most intimate friend,
insists that John shall enter his father's office with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
him, after completing a course at a celebrated Law
School where they now are. Probably this arrangement
will best suit John. I have no hesitation in
predicting for him a noble manhood and an honorable
career. In spite of the gifts of Fortune that he possesses,
I consider his warm and generous heart, his
personal integrity, and his manly character, to be
<span class="smcap">John Oakley's most valuable Inheritance</span>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
